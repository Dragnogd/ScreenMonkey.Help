# Tips and Tricks


## Clip Forward and Reverse

You may have added a number of clips and all you want to do is step through them. The Clip Forward function allows you to do this. When you select Clip Forward it will move to the next clip on the layer which is simply the clip in the next slot. This is different from the linked clip. To move back to the previous clip, select Clip Reverse.

You can either assign hotkeys to the these actions or click the Go button in the [Layers Dashboard](../WorkingWithShows/LayersDashboard.md). By holding down shift and clicking Go, it will move to the previous clip.



## Previous Clip
The previous clip action can be assigned to a keyboard key or MIDI command and will stop the current clip and re-run the last clip to be played.


## Layers and Space Clips
If you are using [Space Clips](../../reference/clipTypes/CueListSpaceClip.md), each Space Clip allows four individual layers to be configured within the Space Clip. The net result of this is that by using Space Clips, you may actually increase the number of layers being displayed at any given time from four to 16. (4 Space Clips X 4 layers)
