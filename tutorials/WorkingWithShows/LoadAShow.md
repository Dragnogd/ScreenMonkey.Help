<h1>How do I load a show?</h1>
<p>Screen Monkey is similar to PowerPoint in that the collection of Clips 
 is referred to as a &quot;Show&quot;. Just as PowerPoint allows you to 
 save and later open a Slide Show you have created, Screen Monkey also 
 allows you to save your shows so that you may easily recall them later.</p>
<p>To Open a saved show, right-click any clip slot and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">File 
 &gt; Open</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_196.jpg" width="282" height="99" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>Screen Monkey will issue the following warning:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/OpenShowWarning.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Click OK and the Open dialog will be presented. Navigate to and choose 
 the folder where you saved the show file. Choose the show and click Open.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/OpenShow.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>In some cases where a media file for a clip has been moved or deleted, 
 the show may not load fully. If this happens you will see the file unavailable 
 icon instead of the clip thumbnail.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_197.jpg" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>The clip can be repaired by locating the original media file. Please 
 see <a class="rvts13" href="../WorkingWithClips/RepairingClips.md">Repairing Clips</a> 
 for more information.</p>

<h2>Loading Show Settings</h2>
<p><span class="rvts10">When you save a show all the current settings are 
 also saved in the show file. This means that when transferring a show 
 between computers you can also transfer the settings. It is not always 
 the case that you want to load all the settings with a show so this must 
 be specified when you open the show. Once you selected a show to load 
 you will be presented with the following window with the name of the show 
 and date it was last modified.</span></p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_200.jpg" width="294" height="208" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p><span class="rvts10">If you click the advanced tab you will also see 
 a number of other items you can load with the show. The Clips should already 
 be selected as this is the default behavior.</span></p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_201.jpg" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>Select all the items you wish to load with the show and click Open.</p>
