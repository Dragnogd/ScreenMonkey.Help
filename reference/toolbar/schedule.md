# Schedule

The schedule viewer is a valuable tool for shows where lots of clips play on scheduled time. It allows you to view the complete upcoming schedule, enable and disable items, manage the [on-screen schedule text clip](../clipTypes/Text/textSchedule.md), and add new schedules. It also has a button for pausing the scheduler.

To view the schedule window click Schedule in the toolbar. Click again to hide it. The schedule can be docked in the main dashboard just like any other window.
