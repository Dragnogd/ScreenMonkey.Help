 Freeze Clip</h1>
<h2>What a Freeze Clip does</h2>
<p>The Freeze Clip allows you to take a snapshot of whatever is on the 
 screen. For example, suppose a <a href="VideoClip.md">Video Clip</a> 
 is playing. Clicking the Freeze Clip captures whatever is on the screen 
 and keeps the image visible. This may be desired if you want to essentially 
 pause playback of the Video Clip to examine some aspect of it and perhaps 
 use the <a href="ScribbleClip.md">Scribble Clip</a> to draw on it.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to configure a Freeze Clip</h2>
<p class="rvps3">When a Freeze clip is added it simply appears in the Screen 
 Monkey Dashboard. Aside from adding a Transition Effect or assigning it 
 to a specific layer, there are no configuration options.</p>
<p class="rvps3">&#160;</p>
<h2>How to use a Freeze Clip during a show</h2>
<p class="rvps3">Perhaps you are playing a Video Clip on Layer 2 and you 
 have assigned the Freeze Clip to Layer 3. You click the Freeze clip and 
 it captures whatever the Video Clip was playing and presents it as a static 
 image on Layer 3. Layer 2 will continue playing along but will not be 
 seen as the Freeze is on Layer 3 and is covering Layer 2.</p>
<p class="rvps3">Or perhaps the reverse is true. You are playing a Video 
 Clip on Layer 3 and you have assigned the Freeze Clip to Layer 2. You 
 click the Freeze Clip and it captures whatever the Video Clip was playing 
 and presents it as a static image on Layer 2. After the Video Clip completes 
 or you fade it out, the static image then appears on Layer 2.</p>
