	<br>
	No one likes to get an error message, least of all in the middle of 
	 an important show. That's why allot of effort is put into ensuring 
	 that Screen Monkey runs without problems, however if something should 
	 go wrong then it will now be handled automatically. Instead of showing 
	 an error message in the middle of a show, any errors are handled automatically 
	 and saved in a log for you to look at later. If an error does occur 
	 you will be notified by the appearance of an exclamation mark in the 
	 control panel. If a clip will not run or has problems loading then 
	 you can click on the exclamation to find out more about the problem. 
	 You can also save a copy of the log to send to Screen Monkey support 
	 and help prevent the problem occurring again.<br>
