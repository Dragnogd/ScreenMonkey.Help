# Cut, Copy, Paste

Screen Monkey behaves like a standard Windows application and supports cut, copy and paste of clips. By using these functions you can quickly duplicate clips or move them between pages.

## Cut 
Remove a clip and place it in the clipboard.

## Copy
Place the clip into the clipboard.

## Paste
Create a new clip from the clipboard. Paste can be used on an empty dashboard slot or on top of an existing clip. If you paste on top of a clip then the clip from the clipboard is inserted and the previous clip occupying the slot and any subsequent clips shuffle down. Nothing is removed.
