# Keeping Organized

The dashboard is where all your clips will live. There are a number of tools which will help you keep everything organised.

- [Rename](clipSettings/rename.md) a clip and change the icon
- [Move](toolbar/edit.md) a clip
- [Clear](clipSettings/clear.md) clips (an empty slot is left behind) 
- [Remove](clipSettings/remove.md) clips (the gap is closed and subsequent clips shuffle up)
- [Cut/Copy/Paste](clipSettings/cutCopyPaste.md) to duplicate or clip or move clips between pages
- Use [pages and bookmarks](pages.md)
- [Add Notes](clipSettings/notes.md) and [View Notes](toolbar/notes.md)
