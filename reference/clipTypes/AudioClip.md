# Audio Clip

The Audio Clip allows you to play an Audio file to the default audio ouptut of the computer. The audio output used is configured in Windows audio device settings.

*Note:* Screen Monkey has no capability to play an audio CD inserted in the computer. You will need first to rip it to a compatible file format so it exists as a file on your computer.

## Add an Audio Clip
Click or Right-click a slot and choose Audio.

You are presented with a file browsing dialog from which you may browse the PC file system and select the Audio clip you wish to use.
