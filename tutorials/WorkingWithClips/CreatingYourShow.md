<h1>Creating Your Show</h1>
<p>Creating a show is a simple process. But before you begin creating, 
 there a few principles which you must understand.</p>
<h2>Main Dashboard</h2>
<p>The Main Dashboard is where media clips are stored and ready for playback 
 to the screen. It consists of different panels, the first panel is always 
 a Clear Layer panel. We will learn more about the Clear Layer panel later 
 in the <a class="rvts13" href="..\WorkingWithShows\RunningYourShow.md">Running a Show</a> 
 topic. The other panels may be used to store a variety of clips.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/img_202.jpg" style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px; 
		 margin-left: 1px; margin-right: 1px;" width="355" height="82" border="0"></p>
<p>You may create any type of clip into any of the remaining panels. When 
 no clip is present in the panel the border is blue. When a clip is loaded 
 the border turns red.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Clips</h2>
<p>There are many different supported clip types. A clip represents some 
 type of visual or audible output to the screen, speakers or both from 
 simple color or image to video. When you run a clip, the contents of that 
 clip are displayed on the screen or played through the sound system.</p>
<p>A clip may also be configured with a Transition and an Effect which 
 specifies how that clip is first shown on the screen.</p>

<h2><span class="rvts12">Pages</span></h2>
<p>Screen Monkey offers an unlimited number of pages available for storing 
 clips. This allows you to cue up a vast number of clips in a show. The 
 current page number is shown in the top of the Main Dashboard.</p>

 Plus and Minus symbols.</p>
