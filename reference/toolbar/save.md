# Save

There are 3 sub menu items which are described below. These functions are also available by right clicking anywhere on the dashboard and choosing the ‘File’ menu.

## Save
Screen Monkey also allows you to save your shows so that you may easily recall them later. When you save a show it will store all the clips and settings in a show file which can be loaded back into the software at a later date. It is recommended to keep frequent saves of any shows to ensure you do not lose any work.

A saved show does not store the original media files it only stores the clip settings. If you would like to include the media save a [Package](#Package). 

If you delete or move the original media files, the show will no longer load successfully. For example, a video clip does not store the original video file. It only contains a link to the video file location. If you move the media files or load the show on a different computer where the media files are located in a different folder then the show can be [repaired](open.md).

The first time you use ‘Save’ Screen Monkey will ask for a filename. The Save dialog will open. Navigate to and choose the folder where you would like to save the show file. Type a name for the show and click Save. 

Any subsequent times you use ‘Save’ the file will be replaced and you will not be asked for a new name.

Screen Monkey shows are saved using a file extension of .smx
