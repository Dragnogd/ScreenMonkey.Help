When you play the clip your selected effects will be applied to the clip. The effects allow you to edit the parameters while the clip is running to make it easy to get the desired look.

##Â Brightness and Contrast Effect

A reset button allows you to return to the default settings. The settings can be modified while the clip is live to ensure you get the correct levels.
