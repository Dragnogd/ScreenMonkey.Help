# Link

If you need to quickly link lots of clips together you can use Link Edit mode. To enter Link Edit just click the Link button in the toolbar or press Ctrl-L.


## Faster Linking
Whilst in Link Edit mode:

- Select a clip (A) you want to link from using the left mouse button and it will be highlighted in blue. 
- Any clips already linked will be shown with a green border and a legend of what type of link exists from the selected clip. 
- To create a link from selected clip (A) to another clip simply right click the target clip (B).
- The link editor for clip (A) will open with clip (B) assigned as the target. 
- Select the link type you wish to add and click OK.
- A link will be added from clip (A) to clip (B).

To leave Link Edit mode click on a different mode in the toolbar.
