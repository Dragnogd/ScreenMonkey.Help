	You are in the middle of your show and you want to freeze the screen 
	 so that the current output stays up. Well with the new Freeze function 
	 this is possible. When you select the Clip type freeze then whenever 
	 you select the clip the current screen output will be frozen until 
	 you select another clip. So maybe you are in the middle of a PowerPoint 
	 and you want to pause it on the current slide or you want to pause 
	 video playback, with the freeze function this is possible. </p></li>

	<br>
	Isn't it annoying when you are using the keyboard to change the PowerPoint 
	 slide and you have to pick up the mouse to change the Screen Monkey 
	 clip? <br>
	<br>
	Well with Global Hotkeys you can now use the keyboard to change the 
	 clip. When Global Hotkeys are enabled the F keys F1 to F7 control 
	 the clip panels. So if you press F1 the Screen Monkey output will 
	 be cleared and F2 to F7 will load the corresponding clip. What is 
	 even better is it does not matter which program you are working in 
	 as the clips will be loaded regardless of the current program. Before 
	 you can start using <a href="../Reference/Hotkeys.md">global Hotkeys</a> 
	 you need to enable it in the <a href="../reference/Setup/Settings/Settings.md">Screen 
	 Monkey user settings</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2"><a name="DragAndDropClips"></a>Drag 
	 and Drop Clips</span><br>
	<br>
	Loading clips into Screen Monkey just got a lot easier. With drag and 
	 drop clips you can simply select the clip file you want to load into 
	 Screen Monkey and&#160;&#160;drag it onto the panel you want to load 
	 it into. It does not matter what the clip is. (Image, Video, PowerPoint) 
	 Screen Monkey will work this all out and get the clip ready for use 
	 as soon as possible.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2"><a name="PowerPointEnhancements"></a><a 
	 href="../reference/clipTypes/PowerPointClip.md">PowerPoint</a> 
	 Enhancements</span><br>
	<br>
	Screen Monkey can now force PowerPoint clips to remain always on the 
	 screen. This prevents another application appearing on top of the 
	 PowerPoint.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2"><a name="PowerPointEffects"></a>PowerPoint 
	 Effects</span><br>
	<br>
	You can now apply effects to PowerPoint clips. So for that professional 
	 look you can have a smooth fade to a PowerPoint slide. This feature 
	 works by grabbing the PowerPoint show. However, there is a small period 
	 when the show is not grabbed and the PowerPoint appears. To prevent 
	 this causing problems I recommend you set PowerPoint to display on 
	 the monitor that is not running the show&#160;by default.</p></li>
