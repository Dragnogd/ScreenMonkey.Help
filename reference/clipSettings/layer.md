# Layer

This sub-menu allows you to quickly change the [target layer](../layers.md) for the clip. 

- In [live mode](../toolbar/live.md) the clip under your mouse pointer where you right click is changed
- In [edit mode](../toolbar/edit.md) you can select multiple clips and change the layer on them all

The sub-menu will indicate the currently selected layer. By default clips are set to ‘Active Layer’ which means they play on the layer highlighted in the panel at the left of the dashboard.
