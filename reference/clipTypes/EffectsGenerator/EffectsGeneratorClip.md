# Effects Generator Clip
The Effect Generator clip provides a way to generate simple moving patterns which have a variety of uses: for example to create a high-contrast moving backdrop for a stage show; creating cool moving effects for use in a night club; creating backgrounds for other Screen Monkey clip types that support transparency; or making simple, bright patterns that can be used to control a large LED screen.

## Create an Effects Generator Clip
When creating a new effects clip you have two choices:

- Choose an effect from the effect library. This is the quickest way to get up and running with effects, you can use one of the library effects as it is, or you can customise it.
    
- Create your own effect from scratch. If you're feeling adventurous you can [make your own effects](WritingYourOwnEffectsScripts.md) using the simple scripting language. You can then add them to the library, allowing you to use them as a starting point for more effects, or reuse your effects in other Screen Monkey shows.  

## Configure an Effects Clip
You may also Customize existing effects. To begin the configuration process, click the middle mouse button or right-click and choose Edit / Cue.

The Effects clip may be assigned to any desired layer and may be assigned a transition.

## Use an Effects Generator Clip in a show
When presenting the live show, click the Effects clip to play it. The animation speed can be adjusted in the Live Monitor.
