# Swap Media

Sometimes you have a clip already in place with links, effects and transitions but you simply wish to change the image, audio or video the clip contains whilst leaving everything else unchanged. To do this you can use the Swap Media function.

To Swap Media, right-click the clip and choose Swap Media from the menu. Then navigate to and choose the new media you wish to use. Click ‘Open’. The clip will be automatically renamed with the filename of the new media.

The Swap Media function is available for the following clip types:

- Audio
- Image  
- Video

*Note:* You can only swap with a media file of the same type. You cannot swap a video with an image for example.
