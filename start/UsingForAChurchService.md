# Using Screen Monkey for a Church Service

In this example, we will use Screen Monkey to help us with a church service. A church service will often contain the following elements.

1. Pre Service Music played from a MP3 media file
2. The Congregation sings and lyrics are projected
3. Prayer or Meditation with key points displayed on screen
6. Announcements or Notices during which upcoming events are promoted using pre-made JPEG image slides
7. Sermon for which the preacher has provided a PowerPoint presentation containing the key points of the talk.
8. Closing Songs
8. Lead out music playlist from YouTube

As you can see, we need to be able to easily present different types of media - audio, video, text, PowerPoint, and YouTube. Screen Monkey can handle all these tasks.

## Preparing Screen Monkey before the service
Before the church service begins, you will want to prepare Screen Monkey.

We need to collect all the of required media and copy or download it onto the computer running Screen Monkey.

To add a media file to Screen Monkey, you click once on any of the blank squares.

(These blank squares are called "slots")

After you click a slot, the Create Clip dialog opens.

Since the first thing we are likely to do is play the lead in music, we find and click the Audio icon followed by OK.

The Open dialog should display allowing us to browse to where the music content is located.

Choose the desired audio file and click Open. In this case, the file name is LeadIn.mp3.

The main Screen Monkey window (called the Dashboard) should now look like this:

The process of adding clips is repeated as shown above until the Screen Monkey dashboard looks similar to this:

At this point we are now ready to USE Screen Monkey during our church service.

## Presenting the media during the church service

Playing the Clips couldn't get much simpler. You click the clip to play it!

Let's walk through the process of presenting our church service. As our service begins, we need to play our Lead In music. So we click the first clip and the Lead In music should begin playing.

Notice how the clip outline turned yellow and you see a small yellow triangle in the upper right corner to let you know it's playing. Also note the letter A in the upper left corner of the clip. This indicates the clip is playing on the Audio layer.

When it's time to begin the service you would likely need to stop the audio if is still playing. Just click once on the LeadIn.mp3 clip and it will stop playing.

At this point in the service the congregation sings along and song lyrics are presented for them to use. You click the first PowerPoint clip and the song lyrics should present on the projector. Again, the clip outline should turn yellow to indicate it's playing.

To advance slides in the PowerPoint presentation, click the clip again. Each successive click should advance the PowerPoint presentation to the next slide.

For the rest of the service you would simply click the clips when you need them so they begin playing.

As you can hopefully see, it's really easy to present the content. Once you are finished playing any given clip, click the "Clear Layer" clip on the left side of Screen Monkey. That will totally clear the layer and immediately stop playing the selected clip.

Using Screen Monkey there was no need for opening PowerPoint, then opening the desired presentation, then starting the slide show. There was also no need to locate the audio files, open and play them using a media player. No need to locate the announcements video file, open it and play it using a media player. Possibly having the player open on the main screen of the PC and having to drag it into the second monitor to present it.

Instead, the show was polished and seamless!

This topic presented one possible use of Screen Monkey. The intent was to provide an overview of how such a situation might unfold. As you may imagine, simplicity was the goal here. There are more efficient ways of working with Screen Monkey. For example, pre-assigning clips so that they appear on specific layers.
