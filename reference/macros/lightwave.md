# LightwaveRF

Lightwave RF is a home lighting automation control protocol which allows control of light dimmers, relays and socket power. Its applications go beyond home use and could be used for raising and lowering screens or anywhere where control of low power (13A) devices is required. To use this macro you must purchased a LightwaveRF Wifi router which connects to your network with Screen Monkey.

Using this macro you can change light dimer levels, select pre-configured moods and turn 13A Sockets On and Off. A relay unit is also available.

Once you add the macro it can be incorporated into your normal Screen Monkey show. Once your command has been setup you can click on the “Try Command” button to check that everything is working.
