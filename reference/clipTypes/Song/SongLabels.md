# Working With Labels

When you create Song Clips you have an ability to create Labels. Labels are a handy way of finding Songs later. For example, for a church setting you may wish to define a Label of Christmas songs. Then associate it with all the different songs using a Christmas theme. Or perhaps Easter. Or perhaps you are presenting song lyrics at a concert. You could define labels by the group that will be performing.

Labels can assist when you need to [Search for songs](SearchingForSongs.md).

## To associate a label with a song:

Open the Cue / Edit dialog for the song by clicking the middle mouse button or right-clicking and choosing Edit / Cue.

Click the Label drop-down and give the song a Label.

Press Enter after typing the Label and the dialog should change a bit.

You may repeat this process to add as many labels as needed.

Click OK after adding the label and Screen Monkey should issue the following prompt:

Click Yes to save the updated song.

After you have added Labels, you may then use them when [Searching for Songs](SearchingForSongs.md).

## To remove a label

A label is removed by clicking on the cross next to the label name.
