# Clear Clip

Right click on a clip you no longer require and select ‘Clear’. The clip will disappear and an empty space will appear in its place. There is no undo!

*Tip:* To quickly clear lots of clips use [Edit mode](../toolbar/edit.md).

*Note:* Use the [Remove](remove.md) option if you wish to close the gap.
