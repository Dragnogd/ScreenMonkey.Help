<h1>Configuring the Appearance</h1>
<p>To Configure the Appearance of a Song Clip, right-click the clip in 
 the Main Dashboard and choose Display Options. (Alternatively, you may 
 edit the clip and choose <span class="hcp2">Tools &gt; Display 
 Options</span> from the <span class="hcp2">Cue</span> dialog.)</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp2">Display Style</span> dialog should 
 open.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 24px;"><img src="../../../images/DisplayStyleEditorSong.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
<p>This dialog will allow you to configure the appearance of your songs. 
 If you are wondering why the dialog has the different colored areas, <a

		<td class="hcp3"><p class="hcp4">Colour</p></td>
		<td>This is the default and the color is black. Clicking the Colour

		 image you choose will be scaled to fill the screen. Additionally, 
		 if the image is configured with a transparent background, the 
		 transparency is respected. Although the filter doesn't list them, 
		 .gif images appear to work here. .gif transparency also appears 
		 to be respected. Animated images are not supported.
