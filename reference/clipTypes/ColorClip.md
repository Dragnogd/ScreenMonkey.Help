<h2>What a Color Clip does</h2>
<p>The Color Clip allows you to flood the screen with a color when you 
 play the clip. You may wish to use Color Clips to temporarily mask the 
 screen as you perform other activities. Or perhaps there is a point in 
 a church service where what is being projected is simply too bright. In 
 this case you might use the black color and fade it a bit to dim the projector 
 output to a more suitable level.</p>

<h2>How to configure a Color Clip</h2>
<p class="rvps3">When a Color clip is added you are presented with a color 
 palette from which you may select the color you wish to use.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 24px;"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_215.jpg" style="margin-top: 1px; 
									 margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 1px; 
									 margin-right: 1px;" border="0"></p>
<p>If the color you want is not in the palette, click <span class="hcp2">Define 
 Custom Colors &gt;&gt;</span> and a full color spectrum will be shown.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the color, click <span class="hcp2">OK</span>. 
 The Clip border will turn red and the slot will change to the reflect 
 the color you selected.</p>

<h2>How to use a Color Clip during a show</h2>
<p class="rvps3">Perhaps you are playing a Video Clip on Layer 1 and you 
 have assigned the Color Clip to Layer 2. You click the Color clip and 
 floods the screen area of Layer 2 with whatever color was configured. 
 Layer 1 will continue playing along but will not be seen as the Color 
 Clip is now playing on Layer 2 and is covering Layer 1.</p>

		<td>Color Clips are a great way to gently fade other things into 
		 or out of view. You use them as a mask and combine them with the 
		 <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithShows/LayersDashboard.md">Layers 
		 Dashboard</a> to manipulate the fading.</td>
