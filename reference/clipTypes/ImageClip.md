 Image Clip</h1>
<h2>What an Image Clip does</h2>
<p>The Image Clip allows you to display a static image on the screen. Any 
 supported image type will be displayed. You may wish to display some graphics 
 or a photo. For example, perhaps you are presenting to a church audience 
 and you know the minister will refer to a certain book during the sermon. 
 You might superimpose an image of the book being discussed so the congregation 
 might more easily find it in the bookstore after service.</p>
<p>Image Clips are a great way to present <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithClips/CreatingAndUsingLowerThirds.md">Lower 
 Thirds</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to configure an Image Clip</h2>
<p>When you choose to add an image clip you are presented with a file browsing 
 dialog that allows you to navigate to and choose the image. After the 
 image has been added to a slot, you may right-click it and choose <span class="hcp2">Display Options</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp2">Display Style Editor</span> dialog 
 is presented.</p>

<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<h2>Image Resizing</h2>
<p>If you choose <span class="hcp2">Stretch</span>, the image 
 is stretched to fill the screen.</p>
<p>If you choose <span class="hcp2">Zoom</span>, the image 
 proportions are maintained and the image is presented at the screen size. 
 (Whichever fills first. Vertical or Horizontal)</p>

		<td>When you create images for use in Screen Monkey, it's best 
		 if you create them at the exact size of your projection system 
		 or device they will be presented on.
		<br>&#160;
		<br>For example, many projectors use 1024x768 as 
		 their resolution. In this case, optimal results are obtained by 
		 configuring images to be that exact size. If you don't, the image 
		 will likely be distorted when it is presented as Screen Monkey 
		 simply assumes whatever you present should appear on the screen. 
		 It has no way of knowing you wanted the image at a specific size 
		 or at a specific screen location. 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br>One way to accomplish this is by constructing 
		 your image in PowerPoint, presenting that at your presentation 
		 size and screen capturing the result for use in Screen Monkey.</td>

<h2>Background Colour</h2>
<p>If you choose <span class="hcp2">Transparent</span> for 
 the Background Color and the image is a type that supports Transparency, 
 then it will be rendered with a transparent background when presented. 
 This is useful when presenting something like a lower third where the 
 image is layered on top of live video.</p>
<p>If you choose <span class="hcp2">Solid</span>, the background 
 will typically be rendered as black.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to use an Image Clip during a show</h2>
<p>Presenting images is just like presenting other clip types. You click 
 the image and it shows on the screen until you either fade it out of view 
 or clear the layer it is being presented on.</p>

		<td>Some image types (such as .GIF) support animation. If you use 
		 a .GIF image type and it is animated, Screen Monkey will only 
		 render a static image and the animation will not occur.</td>
