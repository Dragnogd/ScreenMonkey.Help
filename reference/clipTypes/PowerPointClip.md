 PowerPoint Clip</h1>
<h2>What a PowerPoint Clip does</h2>
<p>PowerPoint is a Microsoft product for creating presentations. Many organizations 
 have no knowledge of Screen Monkey and use PowerPoint alone to present 
 content.</p>
<p>The PowerPoint Clip allows you to Load and run a PowerPoint presentation 
 directly from ScreenMonkey. When using this clip type you have full control 
 of the presentation including the ability to advance the slide.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to configure a PowerPoint Clip</h2>
<p>When you click a slot and choose to add a PowerPoint clip, you are presented 
 with a file browsing dialog from which you may browse the PC file system 
 and select the PowerPoint presentation you wish to use.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/AddAudio.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>It may take some time for the clip to load depending on the size of 
 the presentation. While it is loading a loading animation will be displayed 
 in the panel. Once the presentation has loaded you will see a thumbnail 
 image of the first slide in the presentation.</p>
<p>After the clip has been created you may apply a <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithClips/Transitions.md">Transition</a> 
 or <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithClips/Effects.md">Effect</a> 
 to it.</p>
<p>You may wish to begin the presentation at a different slide number than 
 the first slide. To accomplish this, right-click the clip and choose <span class="hcp4">Start Slide &gt; Slide N</span> (where 
 <span class="hcp4">N</span> represents the slide number 
 you wish to present.)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to use a PowerPoint Clip during a show</h2>
<p>Like other clips, you click once on the clip to begin presenting. </p>
<p>When running PowerPoint there are a number of options you can change 
 to determine how the presentation runs.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_210.jpg" style="margin-top: 1px; 
									 margin-bottom: 1px; margin-left: 1px; 
									 margin-right: 1px;" border="0"></p>
<table style="margin-left: 24px;" cellspacing="0" border="1">
	<col>
	<col>
	<tr>
		<td class="hcp5"><span class="hcp4">Auto 
		 Rewind</span></td>
		<td class="hcp5">Normally when you move to another 
		 clip or clear the screen the presentation is rewound back to slide 
		 1. However if you turn Auto Rewind off under the PowerPoint Playback 
		 Settings then the presentation will be run from the slide being 
		 viewed when the clip was last stopped. If you need to force the 
		 clip to start from the first slide then when playing the clip 
		 hold down the <span class="hcp4">Ctrl</span> key. 
		 This will then rewind the presentation to the start and play the 
		 clip.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="hcp5"><span class="hcp4">Loop</span></td>
		<td class="hcp5">With this set the presentation 
		 will loop back to the first slide when it reaches the last slide. 
		 This option can be set in PowerPoint and if set will be shown 
		 as such in Screen Monkey. However you can override this setting 
		 by selecting loop and toggle whether the presentation is looped 
		 or not.</td>
	</tr>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Because PowerPoint contains different slides, you need an ability to 
 navigate from slide to slide.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp6"><span class="hcp4"><span class="rvts13">Next 
 and Previous Slides</span></span></p>
<p class="hcp2">When the PowerPoint clip is playing each 
 click on the clip in Screen Monkey will advance the PowerPoint presentation. 
 Exactly how the presentation is advanced depends on how it was created. 
 For example, many presentations are created with Bullet Point builds where 
 bullet points are presented one after another on mouse clicks.</p>
<p class="hcp2">If you want to go back to a previous slide, 
 press and hold the shift key while clicking on the clip.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp6"><span class="rvts13">Going to a specific 
 Slide</span></p>
<p class="hcp2">Screen Monkey allows you to configure things 
 so that when playing a PowerPoint presentation you are able to type a 
 slide number and press a key to present that slide number during playback. 
 </p>
<p class="hcp2">For this feature to work you must first assign 
 a terminating key which will indicate you have finished entering the slide 
 number and wish to jump to the slide. The terminating key is configured 
 in the <a href="../Setup/Settings/MouseandKeyboard.md">mouse and keyboard 
 settings</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp6">Using a Remote Control</p>
<p class="hcp7">Often folks will acquire 
 a Remote Control that is used for advancing PowerPoint. <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithShows/UseARemotePointerWithPowerPoint.md">Click 
 here</a> for more information on configuring Screen Monkey to work with 
 these devices.</p>

		<td>Sometimes there are reasons for using PowerPoint separately 
		 from Screen Monkey. For example, you may be able to gain an additional 
		 layer by presenting the PowerPoint using PowerPoint and using 
		 Screen Monkey to provide the four layers that would cover the 
		 PowerPoint show. 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br>You may find that when using PowerPoint that 
		 there are some icons that appear in the lower left corner of the 
		 presentation. 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br><img src="../../images/PPTIcons.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"> 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br>These are turned off in PowerPoint by editing 
		 the options. 
		<br><span class="hcp4">PowerPoint 2003</span> 
		 - <span class="hcp4">Tools &gt; Options &gt; View 
		 &gt; Clear the Show popup toolbar</span> 
		<br><span class="hcp4">PowerPoint 2007</span> 
		 - <span class="hcp4">Office Button &gt; PowerPoint 
		 Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Slide Show &gt; Show popup toolbar</span> 
		 
		<br><span class="hcp4">PowerPoint 2010</span> 
		 - <span class="hcp4">File tab &gt; Options &gt; 
		 Advanced &gt; Slide Show &gt; Show popup toolbar</span> 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br>Additionally, if you are running PowerPoint separately 
		 from Screen Monkey, you may find the OfficeOne PowerShow add in 
		 helpful. PowerShow allows a PowerPoint presentation to play even 
		 when focus moves away from PowerPoint. (as it will when you go 
		 interact with Screen Monkey)

		 OfficeOne PowerShow site 
		<br>&#160; 
		<br>Lastly, if you use PowerPoint in the Presenter 
		 view, you may wish to size the Presenter view so you see both 
		 Screen Monkey and the PowerPoint presenter at the same time. For 
		 this, you may find that installing and using a freeware application 
		 called Sizer is useful. Sizer allows you to easily snap a window 
		 to a pre-determined size and screen position.
