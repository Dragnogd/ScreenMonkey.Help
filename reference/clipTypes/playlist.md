# Playlist Clip

A Playlist Clip is a special [Cue List](CueListSpaceClip.md) intended for creating audio playlists like those you would find in iTunes or Spotify. 

The difference between the regular Cue List and the Playlist is that when files are added to a Playlist they are set to 'Link At End' by default. This means that when a Playlist is played all clips within it will play in sequence one after another automatically.

For all other settings refer to the [Cue List](CueListSpaceClip.md) page.
