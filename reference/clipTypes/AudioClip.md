# Audio Clip

The Audio Clip allows you to play an Audio file to the default audio ouptut of the computer. The audio output used is configured in Windows audio device settings.

*Note:* Screen Monkey has no capability to play an audio CD inserted in the computer. You will need first to rip it to a compatible file format so it exists as a file on your computer.

## Add an Audio Clip
Click or Right-click a slot and choose Audio.

You are presented with a file browsing dialog from which you may browse the PC file system and select the Audio clip you wish to use.

## Configure an Audio Clip

### Mute

### Cue/Edit


Aside from assigning a [Transition](../clipSettings/transition.md) such as fading In, there are no other configuration options.

You may also click and drag audio clips from Windows Explorer to Screen Monkey to add audio.

The supported audio formats are:

*   \*.AAC
*   \*.M4A
*   \*.MP2
*   \*.MP3
*   \*.WAV
*   \*.WMA



When an audio clip has been added, it is automatically assigned to the Audio Layer and the clip has an A indicating this.

When playing an MP3 file that has an ID3 tag with album artwork, the artwork is used as the thumbnail for the clip. Otherwise the default audio clip icon is used.

## Use an Audio Clip during a show
When presenting a show, you click the clip inside Screen Monkey to begin playing it. Clicking the clip again will pause playback.

You may wish to use the [Live Monitor](../toolbar/preview.md) in order to see other playback controls as well as keep an eye on elapsed time and time remaining.
