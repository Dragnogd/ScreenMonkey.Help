# Renaming Clips

Every clip has a name to identify it from other clips. This name is displayed underneath the the clip in the dashboard. This can be [disabled in settings](../Settings/General.md) if you prefer. Clip names are also used when creating links and schedules.

When you create a clip the name is set automatically using either the filename or an appropriate description. It is often helpful to change this name.

## Changing the Clip Name
To change the clip name place the mouse over the clip you wish to change and click the right mouse button to bring up the popup menu. From the menu select “Set Name”. This will bring up a dialog in which you can type in a new clip name. Click OK to change the name.

## Notes
- It is possible to have more than one clip with the same name. Internally Screen Monkey will treat them as separate clips. This is useful if you wish to see the ‘same’ clip on more than one page.
