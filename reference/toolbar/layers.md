# Layers

The layers dashboard provides quick and easy control over all the layers during playback. It allows you to advance to the next clip in a sequence, clear all layers, fade layers in or out either individually or together. 

To open the layers dashboard click on the Layers button in the toolbar. The default view for the layers dashboard is a floating window as shown below but it is often helpful to dock it inside the main window so it is always visible.

Master Go
