# Screen Monkey Application

The Main Window is where you setup and run your show. Inside the main window many different panels can be docked. This section will describe the [default layout](toolbar/window.md).

## Dashboard

Inside the Main Window is the Dashboard.

![](../../images/MainDashboard.png)

When you have installed Screen Monkey and run it for the first time, the dashboard contains nothing but blank squares. The squares are called “slots”. You will then add different media elements to each of the slots. Once added, these elements are called clips. As you add clips the slots should present thumbnail images representing what the clip contains.

The Dashboard may be sized in any configuration that appeals to you. Screen Monkey will respect your arrangement and save it when you close the application. When you close and restart Screen Monkey, your arrangement is reloaded.

You may also change the size of the thumbnail images of the clips presented in the dashboard. This is controlled by visiting the [Screen Monkey Settings](../../reference/setup/Settings/Settings.md).

The first clip in the dashboard is always the Clear Layer clip.

As you present a show using Screen Monkey, content is presented using up to four different [layers](../WorkingWithShows/DisplayLayers.md). Think of layers as being like a physical desktop. The desktop is similar to what you see on the second monitor. If you present something on layer 1, it covers the desktop beneath it. And if something is presented on layer 2, it will cover the desktop as well as covering whatever layer 1 is presenting. Perhaps you are presenting things on all four of the layers and wish to stop presenting whatever is being shown on layer 2. The Clear Layer clip allows you to clear whatever layer you have selected.

## Pages
The grouping of clips and slots inside the Dashboard is referred to as a page. 
Screen Monkey places no restriction on the number of pages that may store clips. There are multiple ways to change the pages so you may view different pages in the Main Dashboard.

## Layers Panel
On the left side of the Dashboard is the Layers panel. This area provides an indication of the selected layer as well as allowing you to select a different active layer by clicking on it.

If you wish to clear a layer you first select it here then click the Clear Layer clip in the first slot (top left) of the dashboard.

Opens this Help System.

![](../../images/ToolBoxEvents.png)

Events/Errors

Opens the Events and Errors dialog where you might see important information about Screen Monkey’s operation.

## Info Bar
The Info Bar displays information about a clip when the mouse passes over the clip. When not showing clip information it displays information about the live clip on the current layer. You may use this to see information such as the full clip name, duration, slides, link and effect. Screen Monkey may be [configured](../../reference/setup/Settings/Settings.md) to hide the info bar if desired.

## Docking Windows
The windows within Screen Monkey are all docakable. This offers an extremely powerful and flexible way of arranging all the different elements of the software. You can arrange all the elements in the way that best suits you.

To change the layout, drag the window to the new position. As you drag the window you will see guides appear indicating where you can drop the window to dock it. Dragging the window away from the main dashboard will cause it to float.

![](../../images/img_187.jpg)

If you drag the window outside all the other windows, it will float. Dropping the window in the center of the guide will cause it to become tabbed.

![](../../images/img_188.jpg)

To view a window that is tabbed, click the tab to make it visible. You may also pin a window so that it is initially hidden but slides out when you click on the window icon. To pin a window, click the Pin icon.

![](../../images/img_189.jpg)

Please note that the window must be docked and not tabbed to see this icon. When the window is pinned it will appear as a small button against the edge it has been pinned to.

You now have a great deal of flexibility to layout the different parts of Screen Monkey, where you want them.

Some helpful tips: 1. To change the layout drag and drop any panel title bar or tab onto a blue indicator 2. Close tabs or panels with the X in the top right 3. Pin items to the side of the screen with the Pin icon
