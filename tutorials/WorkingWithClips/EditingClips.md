<h1>Editing Clips</h1>

<h2>What is cueing?</h2>
<p>Cueing is the process of configuring a video, audio or DVD clip to play 
 a smaller segment.</p>
<p>Many different types of clips support cueing and the cue window changes 
 depending on the clip type you are working with.</p>
<p>When working with video or audio clips, you often simply wish to play 
 a smaller and specific segment of the media or perhaps you wish to begin 
 playing the media at a specific spot. This is where clip cueing helps. 
 It allows you to specify a start time and stop time for Video, Audio and 
 DVD clips so you can choose exactly which bit of the media to present.</p>
<p>There are several different ways you can open the <span class="hcp2">Edit 
 / Cue</span> window for a clip.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Right-clicking on an Audio, DVD or Video clip and selecting 
	 <span class="hcp2">Edit / Cue</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Clicking the <span class="hcp2">toolbar icon</span> 
	 and selecting the desired clip to cue. When you click the toolbar 
	 icon the clips will begin flashing blue to indicate that Screen Monkey 
	 is waiting for a clip to be selected.</p></li>
	<li><p>Clicking on the clip using the middle mouse button or mouse 
	 scroll wheel. This is a nice shortcut instead of being forced to right-click 
	 and use the menu.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Cue Video Clip</h2>
<p>Once you have selected the clip to cue, the Cue dialog should be presented.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_233.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>The main part of the clip window displays the video, which will allow 
 you to choose which section of the video you wish to play.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 54px;">When Cueing enabled is selected &#160;the 
 clip will use the cue times during playback in the main control panel. 
 This is automatically enabled when you set the cue times. If you do not 
 want the clip to use the cue times and just want it to play normally, 
 de-select cueing enabled. This option is also shown when you right click 
 on a clip in the control panel by a tick next to &quot;Cue&quot;.</p>

	The timeline allows you to quickly search through a video clip and 
	 select the cue in and out points. The scroll bar and zoom controls 
	 allow you to view the right point in your video clip. If you need 
	 to see a point in the video that is not in display then you can drag 
	 the scroll bar to the right point. The zoom controls allow you to 
	 zoom in and see the video in more detail.<br>
	<br>
	To play a point in the timeline you can drag the play head to the correct 
	 point and select play. The video will now start playing from this 
	 point in the timeline.<br>
	<br>
	You set the cue in and out point from directly in the timeline by putting

<h2>Cue DVD Clip</h2>
<p>Cueing a DVD is similar to cueing a video but the DVD cue window has 
 a few differences. </p>
<p>The main difference is the support for title and chapter select.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_250.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<ol>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Chapter Control</span> <br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../../images/img_251.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	If you want to jump to a specific chapter or title during cueing, you 
	 may select them from the tree list. The DVD will then jump to the 
	 selected chapter.<br>
	<br>
	The current title and chapter are now displayed above the timecode.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../../images/img_252.jpg" width="268" height="90" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	When a DVD has been cued it will ignore the selected DVD chapter from 
	 the popup menu unless you disable cueing.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp2">Export Cue Settings</span> 
	 <br>
	<br>
	You can save the current cue settings of the DVD to an xml file which 
	 can be taken and used on a sepperate computer.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../../images/img_253.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	To export the cue times, click <span class="hcp2">File 
	 &gt; Export Times</span>. You will then be asked where you want to 
	 save the xml file that will contain the cue times.<br>
	<br>
	To import the cue settings on another computer, create a DVD clip with 
	 the same DVD. Open the cue DVD dialog for the new DVD clip and click 
	 <span class="hcp2">File &gt; Import Times</span>. Locate 
	 the previously saved xml file and click <span class="hcp2">OK</span>. 
	 The new clip will now be configured using the saved cue times.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Cue PowerPoint</h2>
<p>If you middle click with the mouse button on a PowerPoint clip it will 
 bring up the cue dialog, a nice shortcut instead of going through the 
 menu.</p>
<p>In this dialog you can set several options which saves the need to go 
 back to PowerPoint to edit the file.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>You can set a slide that is selected to go Live.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can set a Start Slide if you need a different one to the 
	 prearranged one, and also for the Slide Time.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can set the End slide for the Slide Time.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can set a Slide Time in seconds to automatically advance 
	 the desired slides.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../../images/img_254.jpg" width="419" height="279" border="0" class="hcp4"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The slides which are selected to be displayed are highlighted in blue 
 and the live slide is highlighted in yellow. You can change the selected 
 slides to be displayed by selecting the range of slides and clicking the 
 set slide range button in the top bar.</p>
<p>You can change the live slide by selecting the slide and clicking the 
 play button. If the clip is active then the screen will be updated immediately. 
 You can also set a slide to be live by double clicking on it.</p>
<p>The transition time for slides is set by selecting them and then typing 
 in a new time in the toolbar.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Cue Audio</h2>
<p>The audio clip has a cue control which allows you to specify a start 
 and stop time for the audio clip. The play controls and timeline allow 
 you to navigate the audio to find the in and out points you want. You 
 then select the set In/Out point buttons to play just the clip you want. 
 The loop button can be pressed to create an audio loop.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/img_255.jpg" width="400" height="164" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>The thumbnail in an audio clip is now automatically generated from the 
 album art in the ID3 tag. If your MP3 contains album art in the ID3 tag 
 then you will see that image instead of the default audio clip logo.</p>
