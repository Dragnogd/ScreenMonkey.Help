<p>The <span class="hcp2">Display Style</span> dialog should 
 open and offer many options that are used to configure the appearance 
 of the text.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/TextClipDisplayStyle.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>All settings are stored inside Templates. So it's only logical that 
 you would first define a Template and configure it from there. &#160;If 
 you are wondering why the dialog has the different colored areas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_safe" 
	 target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp2">New Template</span> icon.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/TextClipDisplayStyleTemplate.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Type a name to identify the template and click <span class="hcp2">OK</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/NameTemplate.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>After you have created the template you need to configure it. Notice 
 that your new template already has a <span class="hcp2">Caption</span> 
 named <span class="hcp2">Main Text</span>. Let's add new 
 Captions. </p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp2">New Caption</span> icon.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/TextClipDisplayStyleCaption.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Type a name to identify the caption and click <span class="hcp2">OK</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/Caption.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>You may add any number of captions. Captions simply define where any 
 text assigned to these fields will appear. In the example above, we named 
 our Caption &quot;Header&quot;. As you might imagine, we want the caption 
 to present a heading as well as to be aligned at the top of the display 
 and centered. For this, we select the Header caption in the Captions list, 
 then click the <span class="hcp2">Align</span> icon to choose 
 the desired alignment.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/CaptionAlign.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Note that you may also configure the Font, Font color, Margins, Effect 
 and Transition in the formatting area. These options are pretty intuitive 
 and should need no further explanation.</p>
<p>If you look at the Background section, note that your options are:</p>
<table style="margin-left: 24px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" border="1">
	<col>
	<col>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="hcp2">None</span></td>
		<td>This option removes any Color or Image that has been selected.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="hcp2">Colour</span></td>
		<td>This option allows you to choose a color to be used for the 
		 background.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><span class="hcp2">Image</span></td>
		<td>This option allows you to choose an image to be used for the 
		 background. Note that the image will simply be scaled to fit.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
