<p>Screen Monkey offers the ability to log statistical information about 
 a show. This will allow you to save the information to a playback log 
 in CSV format. (CSV means Comma Separated Value) </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Why might this be useful?</h2>
<p>This can be very useful in TV stations to record the air time a particular 
 advertisement has been played. </p>
<p>Perhaps you are using Screen Monkey for a church service and you wish 
 to see how it has been used in order for planning. You want an automated 
 way to know the timing of when certain elements of Screen Monkey were 
 used.</p>

<h2><a name="Enabled"></a>Turning on Statistics</h2>
<p>Click to place a check mark in the <span class="hcp3">Enabled</span> 
 check box.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../../images/LogEnabled.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>This should enable the option and allow you to choose the name and location 
 of the logging file.</p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp3">Browse</span> button on the 
 far right of the field to open a Windows File Browsing dialog. </p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../../images/LogFileLocation.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Browse to where you wish to store the logging file, type a name to identify 
 the file and click <span class="hcp3">Save</span>.</p>

<h2>Viewing a saved Statistics file</h2>
<p class="hcp5">After you have worked your way through one 
 or more shows with statistics logging enabled you will likely wish to 
 view the data you have collected.</p>
<p class="hcp5">To do this, you must use the Windows File 
 Explorer and locate the file and open it using the application of your 
 choice. A variety of applications may be used to view the file. In this 
 case, the screen capture depicts using Microsoft Excel to view the file. 
 </p>
<p class="hcp5">You may find that double-clicking the file 
 causes Windows Notepad or another application to open. The application 
 that opens depends on what the .CSV file type has been <a href="../FileAssociation.md">associated</a> 
 with in Windows.</p>
