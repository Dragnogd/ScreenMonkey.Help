<h2>What an Effects Generator Clip does</h2>
<p><span class="rvts11">The</span> <span class="rvts12">Effect Generator</span> 
 <span class="rvts11">clip provides a way to generate simple moving patterns 
 which have a variety of uses: for example to create a high-contrast moving 
 backdrop for a stage show; creating cool moving effects for use in a night 
 club; creating backgrounds for other Screen Monkey clip types that support 
 transparency; or making simple, bright patterns that can be used to control 
 a large LED screen.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to configure an Effects Generator Clip</h2>
<p>When creating a new effects clip you have two choices:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Choose an effect from the effect library...<br>
	<br>
	This is the quickest way to get up and running with effects, you can 
	 use one of the library effects as it is, or you can customise it yourself 
	 to make a new effect.</p></li>
	<li><p>Create your own effect from scratch...<br>
	<br>
	If you're feeling adventurous you can <a class="rvts13" href="WritingYourOwnEffectsScripts.md">make 
	 your own effects</a> using the simple scripting language. You can 
	 add them to the library too, allowing you to use them as a starting 
	 point for more effects, or reuse your effects in Screen Monkey shows.<br>
	<br>
	You may also Customize existing effects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To begin the configuration process, click the middle mouse button or 
 right-click and choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit / Cue</span>.</p>
<p>The Effects clip may be assigned to any desired layer and may be assigned 
 a transition.</p>
