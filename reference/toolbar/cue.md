# Cue

Clicking ‘Cue’ will enter cue mode. All clips on the dashboard will flash with a light blue outline. In this mode left clicking on any clip will open its ‘[Edit / Cue](../clipSettings/editCue.md)’ settings dialogue. 

Click on ‘Cue’ again to exit cue mode.

*Note*, A few clip types have no edit / cue settings.
