# Link

If you need to quickly link lots of clips together you can use Link Edit mode. To enter Link Edit just click the Link button in the toolbar or press Ctrl-L.

In link edit mode right-clicking on a clip will immediately open the link browser for the clip.

To leave Link Edit mode click on a different mode in the toolbar.
