<h1>Use a Remote Pointer with PowerPoint</h1>
<p>There are many Remote Control pointers out there that may be used with 
 PowerPoint. </p>
<p>These devices work by sending keystroke commands that are used in PowerPoint 
 to operate the presentation. Often, the keystrokes they transmit are <span class="hcp2">Page Up</span> and <span class="hcp2">Page 
 Down</span>.</p>
<p>Typically, these remote systems will have two components:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>A receiver that connects to the PC. Usually connecting via USB 
	 port. </p></li>
	<li><p>The actual remote device. The remote device usually has just 
	 a few buttons and may have a laser pointer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order for Screen Monkey to work with the remote to operate the presentation, 
 you need to configure the appropriate actions using the <a href="../../Reference/Setup/Settings/MouseandKeyboard.md">Mouse 
 and Keyboard</a> settings.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>To configure for a remote</h2>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Connect the remote device to the computer and test to ensure 
	 it works with PowerPoint generically before introducing Screen Monkey 
	 into the mix.</p></li>
	<li><p>Right-click <span class="hcp2">Main Dashboard</span> 
	 in Screen Monkey and choose <span class="hcp2">Settings</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click <span class="hcp2">Mouse and Keyboard</span>.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="../../images/Remote1.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p></li>
	<li><p>Expand the <span class="hcp2">Dashboard</span> 
	 category.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="../../images/Remote2.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p></li>
	<li><p>Press the button on the remote for <span class="hcp2">Next 
	 Slide</span> and you should see <span class="hcp2">Keyboard 
	 Key Next</span> appear in the <span class="hcp2">Last 
	 Trigger</span> area.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="../../images/Remote3.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p></li>
	<li><p>Double-click <span class="hcp2">Next Slide</span> 
	 to assign this trigger to the Next Slide function.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="../../images/Remote4.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p></li>
	<li><p>Repeat the process from Step 5 to assign the Previous Slide 
	 function.</p></li>
	<li><p>Click <span class="hcp2">OK</span> to dismiss 
	 the Settings dialog.</p></li>
