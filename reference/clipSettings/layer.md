# Layer

This sub-menu allows you to quickly change the [target layer](../layers.md) for the clip. 

- In [live mode](../toolbar/live.md) the clip under your mouse pointer where you right click is changed
- In [edit mode](../toolbar/edit.md) you can select multiple clips and change the layer on them all

The sub-menu will also indicate the current layer.
