Click to choose the device you wish to capture on the left side of the dialog, then click OK.

You may want to assign this clip to a [layer](../layers.md) that is different than the layer your [Live Video](LiveVideoClip.md) feed is on.

## Use a Live Video Snapshot Clip in a show
While playing a Live Video clip, when you see something you wish to capture and freeze frame, click the Live Video Snapshot clip and a freeze frame will be created.
