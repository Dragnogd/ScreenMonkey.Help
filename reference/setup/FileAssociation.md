<h1>File Association</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Windows operating system allows you to associate file 
 types with applications. Once a file type has been associated, you are 
 able to double-click it and the associated application will open.</p>
<p>You may wish to associate certain file types with Screen Monkey so that 
 when you double-click the file in windows they are added as a clip and 
 immediately begin playing on the active layer.</p>
<p>To associate a file type, right-click the file you want to associate 
 and choose &quot;Open With&quot;. Now select &quot;Choose Default Program...&quot;. 
 </p>
<p>This will open the &quot;Open With&quot; dialog from which you need 
 to select &quot;Browse&quot;.</p>

												 margin-right: 1px;" border="0"></p>
<p>Please note that Screen Monkey will not appear in the &quot;Recommended 
 Programs&quot; list if this is the first time you have associated the 
 file. Select the ScreenMonkey.exe from the installation folder and click 
 OK.</p>
<p>If you always want this file type to open and play in Screen Monkey, 
 ensure you enable the option &quot;Always use the selected program&quot;.</p>
<p>Click OK and the file will open and play in Screen Monkey.</p>
