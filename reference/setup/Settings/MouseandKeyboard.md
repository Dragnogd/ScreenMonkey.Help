<p>The Mouse and Keyboard Section enables you to use any mouse action or 
 keyboard keystroke to control Screen Monkey and activate clips.</p>
<p><a name="expand"></a>When the dialog initially appears, all areas are 
 collapsed. You will need to expand an area to view the actions for the 
 area. In the screen capture below, the Dashboard has been expanded.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../../images/MouseKeyboardDashboard.png" border="0" class="hcp3"> </p>
<h2>To assign a keystroke or key combination</h2>
<p>Press the key or key combination you wish to assign, then double-click 
 the action you wish to associate the key or key combination with.</p>
<p>The example below shows the keystroke at the top of the dialog and the 
 action is in bold. In the example below, we have assigned the key combination 
 of <span class="hcp4">Ctrl+G</span> to the <span class="hcp4">Go</span> 
 action. When an action has a key assigned, it appears in bold.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../../images/KeyAssigned.png" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>Each action may have any number of different keys assigned to it. This 
 allows for next slide to be assigned to both the up and the right arrow 
 keys should you wish.</p>
<p>To clear key assignments select the action and click on the clear trigger 
 icon or press the Delete key.</p>

<h2>Assigning Keys to specific clips</h2>
<p>This can also be done from the main clip panel, by pressing and holding 
 the key you wish to assign, then clicking on the clip that you want to 
 be able to control. When you use this approach you will encounter the 
 following warning dialog.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../../images/HotKeyWarning.png" style="border: none;" alt="" border="0"></p>
<p>Of course the dialog may be different, depending on the actual key you 
 pressed.</p>
