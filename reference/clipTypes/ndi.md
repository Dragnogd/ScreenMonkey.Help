# NDI

[Network Device Interface (NDI)](https://www.ndi.tv) is a standard for sending high quality low latency live video and audio over a local ethernet network. There are a wide range of both hardware and software devices capable of transmitting and receiving NDI streams including cameras, vision mixers, and display devices. One of the benefits of NDI is that it is extremely easy to setup and use.

Screen Monkey can receive NDI streams but it cannot generate them. 

To use a NDI stream in Screen Monkey create a new NDI clip. You will then see a preview window with all of the streams detected on the local network. Select the stream you wish to use and click ‘ok’. You may add additional streams by creating more NDI clips.
