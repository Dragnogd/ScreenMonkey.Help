<h1>Searching for Songs</h1>
<p>After you have created and saved many songs you will find yourself needing 
 to periodically search for specific songs while you are creating Song 
 Clips.</p>
<h2>Searching for song text</h2>
<p>Click in the <span class="hcp2">Search</span> field and 
 begin typing the term you are looking for.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong1.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>If this is the first time you have tried using the Search field, the 
 moment you type a key Screen Monkey will issue the following dialog:</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong2.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Click <span class="hcp2">OK</span> and Screen Monkey will 
 present the <span class="hcp2">Browse For Folder</span> 
 dialog where you may choose the folder it will then search.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong3.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Remember, during the process of <a href="CreatingSongClips.md#SaveLoc">Creating 
 Song Clips</a> you saw a tip that advised to save the songs to a certain 
 folder. This is the folder you should browse to and select. Then click 
 <span class="hcp2">OK</span>.</p>
<p>As you type into the Search field, Screen Monkey dynamically presents 
 songs containing the text.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong4.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>When you see the song you want, click it and the contents will be loaded 
 into the dialog. Click the icon shown below to collapse the results.</p>

<h2>Searching the folder of saved songs</h2>
<p>Sometimes you just want to see a list of the songs in a specific folder 
 and choose the song that way. </p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp2">Search</span> icon.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong6.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Screen Monkey will present the <span class="hcp2">Browse 
 For Folder</span> dialog where you may choose the folder it will then 
 search.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong3.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>The songs inside the folder are presented.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SearchSong7.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>

 into the dialog. Click the icon shown below to collapse the results.</p>

<h2><a name="Search_Label_Filter"></a>Search Label Filter</h2>
<p class="rvps8">The song label filter allows you to narrow the search 
 for a specific song to only those songs associated with the label you 
 apply. This provides an easy means to categorize your songs. You may want 
 to apply a label such as &quot;Christmas Songs&quot; so you can search 
 for only songs for Christmas.</p>

<p class="rvps8">The labels may be added to the search by clicking on the 
 labels to the right of the search field and selecting the label you want 
 to add. A label is removed by clicking on the cross next to the label 
 name.</p>
