<h2><a name="CCLI"></a>CCLI</h2>
<p>Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) was established in 
 1988 to provide churches with simple, affordable solutions to complex 
 copyright issues. CCLI helps churches maintain their integrity and avoid 
 costly lawsuits, while also giving churches the freedom to worship expressively 
 and spontaneously. <a href="http://www.ccli.com/" target="_blank">Click

 - A network protocol which allows communication between media servers 
 and lighting consoles. Any supporting lighting console will be able to 
 detect and patch Screen Monkey as well as display thumbnail images of 
 media within Screen Monkey. This is helpful when controlling Screen Monkey 
 via ArtNet. <a href="http://www.plsn.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4439&amp;Itemid=40"

<h2><a name="CODEC"></a>CODEC</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">CO</span>mpressor/<span class="hcp2">DEC</span>ompressor 
 - When content such as Audio or Video is created, it is often Compressed 
 in order to produce smaller files. When it is played back, it must then 
 be Decompressed. What is used is known as a CODEC. There are many CODECs 
 in use today for assorted media types.</p>
<h2><a name="DMX"></a>DMX</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">D</span>igital <span class="hcp2">M</span>ultiple<span class="hcp2">X</span> -<span class="hcp2"> 
 </span>DMX is a standard protocol by means of which theatre lighting control 
 desks can communicate with lighting equipment. It was designed to allow 
 equipment from different companies to be used together easily. <a href="http://www.nomis52.net/?section=projects&amp;sect2=artnet&amp;page=whatis"

<h2><a name="DVD"></a>DVD</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">D</span>igital <span class="hcp2">V</span>ersatile 
 <span class="hcp2">D</span>isc - This is a common format 
 for storing and distributing motion picture content. Because of the use 
 of Video, many folks mistakenly believe it means Digital Video Disc.</p>
<h2><a name="Letterboxing"></a>Letterboxing</h2>
<p>When many video types are recorded, they are recorded at a size that 
 isn't really compatible with televisions. For many years, televisions 
 offered a 4x3 aspect ratio. This meant four units across by three units 
 up and down. So if the units were measured in feet, a very large television 
 would measure four feet across by three feet high. Often, video content 
 is recorded in a 16x9 format. Because of this, when content intended for 
 16x9 is played on a device expecting 4x3, it is often &quot;letterboxed&quot; 
 so that the full 16x9 fits on the 4x3 screen. When letterboxing occurs, 
 you normally see black bars appearing on the screen above and below the 
 video content.</p>

<h2><a name="LowerThird"></a>Lower Third</h2>
<p>When you see television news reports and an interview occurs, you often 
 see what is called a &quot;Lower Third&quot; that presents the title and 
 name of the person being interviewed. These are typically placed on top 
 of the video image in the bottom 1/3 of the screen area. <a href="tutorials/WorkingWithClips/CreatingAndUsingLowerThirds.md">Click 
 here</a> for information on creating your own Lower Thirds for use with 
 Screen Monkey. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_third" target="_blank">Click

<h2><a name="MIDI"></a>MIDI</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">M</span>usical <span class="hcp2">I</span>nstrument 
 <span class="hcp2">D</span>igital <span class="hcp2">I</span>nterface 
 - This is an industry-standard protocol that enables electronic musical 
 instruments (synthesizers, drum machines), computers and other electronic 
 equipment (MIDI controllers, sound cards, samplers) to communicate and 
 synchronize with each other. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi"

<h2><a name="MSEX"></a>MSEX</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">M</span>edia <span class="hcp2">SE</span>rver 
 e<span class="hcp2">X</span>tensions - The Media Server 
 Extensions layer is the part of the suite of protocols that is used for 
 communication between a controller and a media server. It allows information 
 for specified elements to be passed from the media server to the console 
 and/or visualizer. <a href="http://www.plsn.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4439&amp;Itemid=40"

<h2><a name="Pillarboxing"></a>Pillarboxing</h2>
<p>Sometimes video content is recorded in a 4x3 format and played back 
 on a 16x9 device. Because of this, when content intended for 4x3 is played 
 on a device expecting 16x9, it is often &quot;pillarboxed&quot; so that 
 the full 4x3 fits on the 16x9 screen. When pillarboxiing occurs, you normally 
 see black bars appearing on the screen to the left and right of the video 
 content.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="images/Pillarboxed.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<h2><a name="Pixel"></a>Pixel</h2>
<p>The term Pixel is a contraction between the words <span class="hcp2">PI</span>cture 
 and <span class="hcp2">EL</span>ement. Pixels are the smallest 
 unit of measurement for a computer screen. All the different Pixels combined 
 make up the mosaic of the image presented on the screen.</p>
<h2><a name="RDM"></a>RDM</h2>
<p><b>R</b>emote <b>D</b>evice <b>M</b>anagement or <b>RDM</b> is a protocol 
 enhancement to USITT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512" title="DMX512">DMX512</a> 
 that allows bi-directional communication between a lighting or system 
 controller and attached RDM compliant devices over a standard DMX line. 
 This protocol will allow configuration, status monitoring, and management 
 of these devices in such a way that does not disturb the normal operation 
 of standard DMX512 devices that do not recognize the RDM protocol. The 
 standard was originally developed by the Entertainment Services and Technology 
 Association - Technical Standards (ESTA) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" 
											 href="http://tsp.plasa.org/tsp/about/index.html">[1]</a> 
 and is officially known as &quot;ANSI E1.20, Remote Device Management 
 Over DMX512 Networks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDM_(lighting)"

<h2><a name="RelativePathing"></a>Relative Pathing</h2>
<p>When creating links or references to files or web pages, there are two 
 ways to reference the file or page.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>One is called <span class="hcp2">Absolute</span></li>
	<li>The other is called <span class="hcp2">Relative</span></li>
</ol>
<p>If an<span class="hcp2"> Absolute</span> link or reference 
 is created, it means that the file or page linked to is expected to be 
 found in a specific location, such as perhaps C:\SomeFolder\SomeOtherFolder\SomeFile.EXT.</p>
<p>If a Relative link or reference is created, it means that the file or 
 page linked to is expected to be found in a location that is *Relative* 
 to the current location. For example, one folder above where you are, 
 the same folder you are in or a folder below where you are.</p>
<p>Screen Monkey 3.7 uses <a href="releases/Version_3_7.md#RelativePaths">Relative 
 Paths</a> for links to its Media files.</p>
<h2><a name="VOB"></a>VOB</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">V</span>ideo <span class="hcp2">OB</span>ject 
 - This is a file type stored on DVD media. The VOB typically contains 
 the motion picture as well as the audio content.</p>
<h2><a name="URL"></a>URL</h2>
<p><span class="hcp2">U</span>niform <span class="hcp2">R</span>esource 
 <span class="hcp2">L</span>ocator - A URL often contains 
 a domain name. For example, http://www.google.com is a URL.</p>
