<h1>Using Screen Monkey for a Conference</h1>
<p class="hcp2">In this example, we will assume we are using 
 Screen Monkey to help us with a conference. The conference will contain 
 the following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead in music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead in music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadIn.MP3</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Image with Conference Logo</span><br>
	<br>
	While the Lead in music is playing an image with the conference logo 
	 is presented via multiple projection systems. The conference logo 
	 is an image named <span class="hcp4">ConferenceOpener.PNG</span>.</p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span class="hcp3">Master 
	 of Ceremonies and Keynote Speaker</span><br>
	<br>
	A live video feed will present all stage activity on the projection 
	 systems. The computer is equipped with a video capture device named 
	 <span class="hcp4">Video WebCam</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Supplemental Images and Lower 
	 Thirds</span> <br>
	<br>
	During the keynote speech, Lower Thirds will be used to identify the 
	 presenters. During the keynote, the presenter will advise the audience 
	 that books and other materials are available in a specific area. These 
	 images will be superimposed on top of the live video. There are three 
	 images involved.</p></li>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Emcee.PNG</span> <br>
		<br>
		Provides a lower third to identify the Master of Ceremonies.</p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Keynote.PNG</span> <br>
		<br>
		Provides a lower third to identify the Keynote speaker.</p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">BookImage.PNG</span> <br>
		<br>
		Provides an image of the book the Keynote speaker has written.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead out music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead out music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadOut.MP3</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, we need to be able to easily present different types 
 of media. For our example conference, we have two different audio files 
 in MP3 format, a live video feed and a few different images that will 
 be presented and even superimposed over the video.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 12px;">Preparing Screen Monkey before the conference</h2>
<p>Long before the conference begins, you will want to prepare Screen Monkey. 
 </p>
<p>First, we add these files to Screen Monkey.</p>
<p>To add a media file to Screen Monkey, you click once on any of the blank 
 squares.</p>
<p>(These blank squares are called &quot;slots&quot;)</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ClickEmptySquare.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>After you click a slot, the <span class="hcp3">Create 
 Clip</span> dialog opens.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\CreateClip.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Since the first thing we are likely to do is play the lead in music, 
 we click the <span class="hcp3">Audio</span> icon followed 
 by <span class="hcp3">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp3">Open</span> dialog should display 
 allowing us to browse to where the music content is located. </p>
<p>For this example, I placed all the content inside the same folder. I 
 selected the <span class="hcp4">LeadIn.MP3</span> 
 file and clicked <span class="hcp3">Open</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\OpenAudio.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The main Screen Monkey window (called the Dashboard) should now look 
 like this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\FirstClipAdded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The process of adding clips is repeated as shown above until the Screen 
 Monkey dashboard looks similar to this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ConferenceLoaded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>At this point we are now ready to USE Screen Monkey during our conference.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Presenting the media during the conference</h2>
<p>Let's walk through the process of presenting the show at our conference. 
 As the conference begins, we need to play our Lead In music as well as 
 present the conference image. So we click the LeadIn clip once and the 
 Lead In music should begin playing. Then we click the Conference image 
 once and it should begin presenting on the projectors connected to the 
 computer.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ConferenceStart.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Notice how the clip outlines turn yellow. For the audio clip, a small 
 yellow triangle appears in the upper right corner to let you know audio 
 is playing. Also note the letter <span class="hcp3">A</span> 
 in the upper left corner of the clip. This indicates the clip is playing 
 on the <span class="hcp4">Audio</span> 
 layer. Notice the clip to the immediate right. This is the conference 
 image and the bright yellow border indicates it's the active layer. If 
 you look at the left side of the Dashboard, the L1 square is highlighted 
 to let you know Layer 1 is presenting the image.</p>
<p>When the Master of Ceremonies (EmCee) approaches the stage it's time 
 to stop playing the LeadIn music and start presenting the live video feed. 
 Notice the little row of squares on the left side of the Main Dashboard. 
 Each of these represents a layer. Click the <span class="hcp3">Audio</span> 
 layer to select it, then click the <span class="hcp3">Clear 
 Audio</span> clip.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ClickAudioLayer.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp3">L1</span> layer to select 
 it, then click the <span class="hcp3">video camera</span> 
 icon to start the feed and the live video will begin presenting on the 
 projectors. &#160;We selected L1 because that is the layer that will be 
 &quot;behind&quot; all the others. </p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\startcamera.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>At this point the EmCee is on stage and about to begin talking to the 
 audience and introduce the keynote speaker. When the address begins, you 
 will want to display the <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a1" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('Reference/Glossary.md#LowerThird',400,150);return false;">lower third</a> that will present 
 the EmCee's name.</p>
<p>To display the lower third, click the <span class="hcp3">L2</span> 
 layer to select it, then click the <span class="hcp3">EmCee 
 clip</span> to present it. Because you first selected L2, the Emcee clip 
 is presented on Layer 2. This means Layer 1 is still presenting the live 
 video feed and Layer 2 is presenting in front of the Live video feed. 
 So your audience sees both at the same time.</p>
<p>As you can hopefully see, it's really easy to present the content. Once 
 you are finished playing any given clip, click the layer on the left side 
 to choose it, then click the &quot;Clear Layer&quot; clip on the left 
 side of Screen Monkey. That will totally clear the layer and immediately 
 stop playing the selected clip.</p>
<p>Using Screen Monkey, there was no need for locating the audio files, 
 opening and playing them using a media player. No need to use something 
 like a mechanical A/B switch to change from presenting live video to images 
 or images to live video.</p>
<p>Instead, the show was polished and seamless!</p>
