<h2>What a Live Audio Clip does</h2>
<p>The Live Audio clip allows you to connect to a live audio feed. You 
 can use this clip to play audio from any sound card input. This is useful 
 if you want to automatically switch between live and pre-recorded content 
 or you want to mix live audio with content from Screen Monkey.</p>

		<td>Before this clip type will work, you must have some form of 
		 live audio feed connected to the computer. This may mean you need 
		 to acquire and install additional hardware and software. Usually 
		 in the form of a sound card or USB device.</td>

<p>Adding the Live Audio clip is the same as adding any other clip type. 
 Either click or right-click an empty slot and choose <span class="hcp3">Live 
 Audio</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp3">Live Audio Clip</span> dialog should 
 display.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 24px;"><img src="../../images/LiveAudioDialog.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp2"></p>
<p>Note that what this dialog will present will depend entirely on the 
 device(s) connected to your computer. The example above lists one device. 
 But yours may have only one, more than one or possibly none, depending 
 on whether you have a device actually connected or not.</p>
<p>Assuming you have a device connected, click to choose it and the other 
 options may become available. </p>
<p>Once you have configured things, click <span class="hcp3">OK</span> 
 and the Live Audio clip should be added to the Main Dashboard.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to use a Live Audio Clip during a show</h2>
<p>Using the Live Audio is as simple as clicking the icon. You click the 
 icon and the Live Audio feed should initialize and appear. You may wish 
 to fade a Live Audio feed in and out as needed using the <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithShows/LayersDashboard.md">Layers 
 Dashboard</a>.</p>
