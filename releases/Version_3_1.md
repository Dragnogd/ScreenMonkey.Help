	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="ClipScheduler"></a>Clip 
	 Scheduler</span><br>
	<br>
	The scheduler allows you specify a time and date when a clip will be 
	 run. This is specifically useful if Screen Monkey is running unattended 
	 and you need to display videos or images at set times in the day such 
	 as with a local TV station. It also allows you to set a repeat time 
	 if you want to show a clip every 10min.<br>

	 href="../reference/clipTypes/FlashClip.md">Flash</a> Hotkey Inject</span><br>
	<br>
	The previous version allowed you to specify keys to send to a flash 
	 presentation for the purposes of navigation. This has been changed 
	 so the flash clip has a specific set of custom actions which you are 
	 allowed to assign key presses to. The only noticeable change is that 
	 instead of the assignments being listed under &quot;Custom Action&quot; 
	 it is now listed under &quot;Flash&quot;.</p></li>

	 Speed</span><br>
	<br>
	You can now set the time taken for the song words to transition from 
	 one verse to the next. You have four speed options &quot;No Transition&quot;, 
	 &quot;Fast Transition&quot;, &quot;Normal Transition&quot; and &quot;Slow 
	 Transition&quot;. To set the transition speed go to the song clip 
	 display style editor and select the speed you require.<br>

	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Song_Text_Effects"></a>Song 
	 Text Effects</span><br>
	<br>
	When displaying song words over an image background you often need 
	 an effect such as drop shadow or text outline to ensure the words 
	 stand out. The new song text effect does exactly this. It gives you 
	 the option to add both an outline and drop shadow to the text. Both 
	 effects are highly configurable to ensure you get exactly the effect 
	 you want. You change the text effect by selecting the Effect button 
	 in the display style editor and then adjusting the settings till you 
	 get the desired effect.<br>

	<br>
	The info bar displays information about a clip when the mouse passes 
	 over the clip. When not showing clip information it displays information 
	 about the live clip on the current layer. You can use this to see 
	 information such as the full clip name, duration, slides, link and

	<br>
	There is now a new user setting to disable thumbnail generation in

	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Hotkey_Handled"></a>Hotkey 
	 Handled</span><br>
	<br>
	In previous versions of Screen Monkey any global <a href="../reference/Hotkeys.md">hotkeys</a> 
	 would always be routed to Screen Monkey. This prevented that key from 
	 being used in other applications. Now the key is only used in Screen 
	 Monkey if that operation is available. For example the next and previous 
	 slide hotkeys are only needed if a slide show is actually running. 
	 This key will now only be disabled in other applications if a slide 
	 clip is being displayed.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Show_Drop"></a>Show 
	 Drop</span><br>
	<br>
	With show drop you can quickly add clips from other shows saved in 
	 Screen Monkey. All you do is drag the show file you want to add clips 
	 from into a panel. The clips in that show will then be added starting 
	 at this panel. You can use this to create new shows using components 
	 from old shows.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Clip_Forward_and_Reverse"></a>Clip 
	 Forward and Reverse</span><br>
	<br>
	You may have added a number of clips and all you want to do is step 
	 through them. The Clip Forward function allows you to do this. When 
	 you select Clip Forward it will move to the next clip on the layer 
	 which is simply the clip in the next slot. This is different from 
	 the linked clip. To move back to the previous clip you just select 
	 Clip Reverse. You can either assign hotkeys to the these actions or 
	 press the Go button in the Layers Dashboard. By holding down shift 
	 and pressing Go it will move to the reverse clip.<br>

	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Insert_Clip"></a>Insert 
	 Clip</span><br>
	<br>
	This is extremely useful and a feature that has been lacking in previous 
	 versions. You often want to add new clips into your play order at 
	 the last minute and until now there has been no easy way to do this. 
	 Now with insert clip you can add in a new clips and any adjacent clips 
	 will be shifted along. All you have to do is add the clip to the slot 
	 you want it to appear in. If a clip already exists in that slot then 
	 it will be moved to the slot on the right. Previously the clip would 
	 just have been deleted.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Remove_and_Clear"></a>Remove 
	 and Clear</span><br>
	<br>
	As well as inserting a clip you also need to be able to reverse this 
	 by removing a clip. So the remove function has now changed behavior. 
	 When you remove a clip any adjacent clips will be shifted into the 
	 empty slot. The old behavior of Remove is now Clear. When you select 
	 clear the clip will be deleted and an empty clot will be left.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Docking_Layer_Monitor_Windows"></a>Docking

	<br>
	The layer monitors are now all dockable allowing you to configure them

	 in tabs on top of each other or all viewable in separate windows you 
	 can. This now gives you the ability to easily see what is going on 
	 in all the layers at once. To move the windows around just simply 
	 click and drag the tab of a layer out of the monitor window.<br>

	With v3 when the application started it would always have to re-generate

	Several options allow you to customize how images are displayed. Image 
	 re sizing allows you to either stretch the image to fit the screen 
	 or maintain the proportions and show a black border where the image 
	 does not fit the screen. You can also set the background to transparent 
	 which allows transparent images to display the layers beneath. You

	These buttons allow you to quickly fade in and out a layer. They can 
	 be useful when quickly putting together a show and when you need to

	You may need to go from picture in picture to full screen during a 
	 live show. The profile transitions allow you to do that. You can change 
	 on the fly the display profile used and it will seamlessly change 
	 to that profile with the given speed. If the new layer position is 
	 different then the layer will travel to its new position and size.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../images/img_145.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	The profile control shows you the current profile and the next profile 
	 to go to. An image representation of what the profile might look like 
	 is shown. Use the drop down lists to change either the live or the 
	 next profile. When you want to change the profile click on the go 
	 button and it will transition to the new profile.<br>
	<br>
	The speed of the transition is set using the speed fader.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../images/img_146.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	Please note that some of the transitions are a bit steppy at this time.

	A bug was fixed where if you did not have &quot;Use effects on clip 
	 out&quot; selected in the settings it would cause clips not to stop 
	 when the clear screen button was pressed. After this any future clips 
	 would also not stop and lock on.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Custom_Layer_Shape"></a>Custom 
	 Layer Shape</span><br>
	<br>
	It is not always the case that your screen will be rectangular. Screen 
	 Monkey believes that you should not limit yourself to rectangles and 
	 that is why it now provides for shaped layers. You can create just 
	 about any shape of layer you want.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../images/img_150.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	In the profile editor you just need to select what shape you want from 
	 rectangle, polygon and circle.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="../images/img_151.jpg" border="0" class="hcp4"><br>
	<br>
	Now just stretch and mold the layer to your desired shape.<br>

	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Events_Errors_Loading_Animation"></a>Events 
	 &amp; Errors Loading Animation</span><br>
	<br>
	The events and errors dialog now shows a loading animation while the 
	 events are being loaded.<br>
