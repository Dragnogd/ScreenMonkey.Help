# Clear Layer Clip

The Clear Layer Clip allows you to clear any layer of content that is being played or presented.

There is always a Clear Active Layer clip in slot 1 (top left) of the Dashboard on every page. This clip type allows you to create aditional clear layer clips in other locations and to assign them to specific layers. This clip is also very useful for ending a series of linked clips.

## Create a Clear Layer Clip
Click an empty slot and choose Clear Layer. 

## Configure a Clear Layer Clip
Right clip on the clip icon and use the [layer menu](../clipSettings/layer.md) to assign the clip to a layer of your choice.

## Use a Clear Layer Clip during a show
During a show you may click the clip in order to clear the layer. 

If you have a series of linked clips that play one after the other then you may need to insert a clear layer clip at the end of the sequence to ensure the last clip is cleared and Screen Monkey is ready for the next clip to play.
