 Live Video Clip</h1>
<h2>What a Live Video Clip does</h2>
<p>The Live Video clip allows you to present a live video feed on the second 
 monitor. The live video may be obtained from any connected camera, web 
 cam or capture card and will be displayed directly on the screen. You 
 can use this clip to seamlessly and smoothly switch between static graphics 
 and live video. Screen Monkey works with most video capture cards and 
 live video interfaces.</p>

		<td>Before this clip type will work, you must have some form of 
		 live video feed connected to the computer. This often means you 
		 need to acquire and install additional hardware and software. 
		 Usually in the form of a video capture card or USB device. Common 
		 devices are the <a href="http://www.viewcast.com/products/osprey-cards" 
							 target="_blank">ViewCast Osprey</a> (installed 
		 in a desktop computer) and the <a href="http://us.kworld-global.com/main/prod_in.aspx?mnuid=1306&amp;modid=10&amp;prodid=104&amp;flag=1" 
											 target="_blank">K-World USB</a> 
		 (connects to USB ports and may be used with Desktop or Laptop 
		 computers). You must also install the drivers the device will 
		 need.

<p>Adding the Live Video clip is the same as adding any other clip type. 
 Either click or right-click an empty slot and choose <span class="hcp5">Live 
 Video</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp5">Live Video Clip</span> dialog should 
 display.</p>
<p class="hcp6"><img src="../../images/LiveVideoClipDialog.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Note that what this dialog will present will depend entirely on the 
 device(s) connected to your computer. The example above lists three devices. 
 But yours may have only one, more than one or possibly none, depending 
 on whether you have a device actually connected or not.</p>
<p>Assuming you have a device connected, click to choose it and the other 
 options should then become available. </p>

		<td>Often the settings include a buffer size. The buffer is used 
		 to store video frames while the computer processes them. This 
		 prevents frames from being dropped when you are capturing to a 
		 file. However, when displaying live this buffer may cause a delay 
		 which is more noticeable than dropping frames. It is recommended 
		 that you reduce the buffer size to the minimum to get the best 
		 performance from your capture device.</td>

<p>Note that you may also choose an Audio device. </p>
<p>In many setups it won't be necessary to choose Audio. This is because 
 in many environments audio is handled separately through a separate sound 
 system with many microphones and a multiple channel mixing board. However, 
 in some circumstances such as TV, it may be helpful to link the video 
 to an audio input so the audio fades with the video. This is done by selecting 
 the audio input from the drop down list.</p>

<p>Once you have configured things, click <span class="hcp5">OK</span> 
 and the Live Video clip should be added to the Main Dashboard.</p>
<p class="hcp6"><img src="../../images/LiveVideoAdded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Note that the image above depicts the words &quot;Live Video&quot; below 
 the camera. This is because after adding the clip, it was right-clicked 
 and Renamed to those words. Otherwise it would show whatever the device 
 name was that you selected in the dialog.</p>

<h2>How to use a Live Video Clip during a show</h2>
<p>Using the Live Video is as simple as clicking the icon. You click the 
 icon and the Live Video feed should initialize and appear. You may wish 
 to fade a Live Video feed in and out as needed using the <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithShows/LayersDashboard.md">Layers 
 Dashboard</a>.</p>
