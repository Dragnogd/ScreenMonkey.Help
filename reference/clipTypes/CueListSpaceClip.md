 Cue List / Space Clip</h1>
<h2>What a Space Clip does</h2>
<p>A Space Clip is a special type of clip. It allows you to store several 
 clips in one place and play them back from a central location. This may 
 help you better organize your operations in Screen Monkey or you may wish 
 to configure the clips so they play one after another after a certain 
 time has elapsed.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you are using Screen Monkey to manage visuals for 
 a concert with three different groups and several members in each group. 
 You may choose to create a space clip for each group. Inside the Space 
 Clip would be all the media assets related to the group. </p>
<p>If you didn't use Space Clips, your Main Dashboard may look like this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/MainDashMessy.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>That's quite a jumble of clips and you would be hard pressed to determine 
 which clip is what when you needed it, no?</p>
<p>Using Space Clips, you are able to easily organize them by group. In 
 this case the Main Dashboard might look like this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/MainDashOrganized.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>When you play the space clip and open the Cue window, you are able to 
 play the other clips listed in the Cue window. Typically the first clip 
 you have added to the Cue window list will begin playing when you play 
 the Space Clip. And each successive click on the Space Clip in the Main 
 Dashboard advances to the next clip listed.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/SpaceClipCueDialogPlaying.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How to configure a Space Clip</h2>
<p>When you click a slot and choose to add a Space clip, you are prompted 
 to provide a name to identify the space.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/SpaceClipName.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Type a name into the field and click <span class="hcp5">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The Space clip is added to the Main Dashboard and the Cue window is 
 displayed waiting for you to add clips.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/SpaceClipAdded.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/SpaceClipCueDialog.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>There are three ways to add clips to the Cue window.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Clicking the blank area of the window</p></li>
	<li><p>Clicking the <span class="hcp5">Add</span> icon 
	 in the window toolbar<br>
	<br>
	When you click the blank area of the Cue window or click the Add icon, 
	 Screen Monkey behaves in the same way it does when clicking an empty 
	 slot. It presents a dialog where you choose a Clip type to add. Select 
	 the Clip type and click <span class="hcp5">OK</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Clicking and dragging files into the window<br>
	<br>
	Files may be dragged from Windows Explorer or you may click and drag 
	 clips from the Screen Monkey Main Dashboard to the Cue window.</p></li>
</ul>
<table cellspacing="0" border="1" class="hcp6">
	<col>
	<col>
	<tr>
		<td class="hcp7"><img src="../../images/Noteimage.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></td>
		<td>A handy tip is that when dragging files from Windows Explorer 
		 onto an empty slot in the Main Dashboard, you may press and hold 
		 the Alt key as you click and drag. This will cause a Space Clip 
		 to be created that contains the selected files. This is a handy 
		 shortcut to creating spaces containing lots of clips.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>To edit the clips within a space, click once to select them with the 
 mouse so they are highlighted in lavender, then right-click to display 
 the clip menu. You will have the same options as you do if the Clip were 
 in the Main Dashboard. (Transition, Layer, Effect, etc.)</p>

<h2>How to use a Space Clip during a show</h2>
<p>Before any of the items listed in a Space clip will appear, you must 
 click the <span class="hcp5">Space Clip</span> in the Main 
 Dashboard to play it. The clip listed first in the Cue dialog should then 
 appear on the screen or begin playing. (if it's an Audio or Video clip)</p>
<p>After playing the Space Clip in the Main Dashboard, the <span class="hcp5">Cue</span> 
 dialog should be opened. You may wish to open the dialog before actually 
 playing the Space Clip.</p>
<p>To open the Cue dialog, Click the Space Clip using the middle mouse 
 button or right-click the Space Clip and choose <span class="hcp5">Edit 
 / Cue</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" src="../../images/SpaceClipCueDialogPlaying.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>The live clip is highlighted in orange and this turns to yellow when 
 the space is playing and the live clip is actually on the screen. You 
 can change the live item by double clicking on a clip.</p>
<p>The Cue toolbar allows you to work with the clips that are part of the 
 space.</p>
