# Remove Clip

Right click on a clip you no longer require and select ‘Remove’. The clip will disappear and any subsequent clips on the current page will shuffle up to close the gap. There is no undo!

*Tip:* To quickly remove lots of clips use [Edit mode](../toolbar/edit.md).

*Note:* Use the [Clear](clear.md) option if you wish to leave a gap.
