Welcome to Screen Monkey
========================

Screen Monkey is a Windows application that allows you to quickly and easily present media content on display devices connected to your computer, control other presentation equipment, and even schedule a complete TV channel.

If Screen Monkey did not exist, you would likely see lots of fumbling around as PowerPoint presentations are loaded up and started. There would likely be delays and potentially be mix-ups as various Media Players are started and loaded on the computer to present video clips or play songs. Perhaps the players would need to be dragged from the primary monitor to the second in order for the audience to see them. In order to present a live video feed coming from a camera, you might need to resort to an A/B switch to control what is sent to the projector. This provides for a "less than optimal" presentation.

Screen Monkey allows you to easily manage all this and more in order to provide a seamless and professional presentation. Playing videos, music, songwords, PowerPoint, live video content or other elements becomes as simple as clicking the mouse.
