The Mouse and Keyboard Section enables you to use any mouse action or keyboard keystroke to control Screen Monkey and activate clips.

When the dialog initially appears, all areas are collapsed. You will need to expand an area to view the actions for the area. In the screen capture below, the Dashboard has been expanded.

## To assign a keystroke or key combination

Press the key or key combination you wish to assign, then double-click the action you wish to associate the key or key combination with.

The example below shows the keystroke at the top of the dialog and the action is in bold. In the example below, we have assigned the key combination of Ctrl+G to the Go action. When an action has a key assigned, it appears in bold.

Each action may have any number of different keys assigned to it. This allows for next slide to be assigned to both the up and the right arrow keys should you wish.

To clear key assignments select the action and click on the clear trigger icon or press the Delete key.

## Assigning Keys to specific clips

This can also be done from the main clip panel in trigger edit mode, by pressing and holding the key you wish to assign, then clicking on the clip that you want to be able to control. When you use this approach you will encounter the following warning dialog.

Of course the dialog may be different, depending on the actual key you pressed.
