	<br>
	The new MIDI control interaction allows you to specify MIDI notes to 
	 perform certain actions within Screen Monkey. This gives you huge 
	 capability to connect external control surfaces and other MIDI devices 
	 such as lighting desks. The MIDI notes used to perform a specific 
	 action need to be setup in the settings window under MIDI before it 
	 will respond to MIDI notes. You will need a MIDI port connected to 
	 your computer or a MIDI to USB adapter.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Mouse_and_Keyboard_Interaction"></a>Mouse 
	 and Keyboard Interaction</span><br>
	<br>
	This feature was originally conceived out of a request to always have 
	 the mouse in control of a PowerPoint presentation. I wanted to allow 
	 one mouse to be assigned to Screen Monkey and the other left free 
	 to use in Windows. What resulted was an extremely powerful and flexible 
	 mouse and hotkey system. The principle is that you have actions you 
	 wish to perform in Screen Monkey like run a clip. This interaction 
	 allows you to assign any mouse or keyboard key to that action. So 
	 if you assign the right mouse key to play clip 1 it will play clip 
	 1 when you press the right mouse key. It gets better than that though 
	 as you can connect multiple mice and keyboards and assign different 
	 actions to keys on different keyboards. So you can have one keyboard 
	 dedicated to controlling Screen Monkey while the other keyboard has 
	 no effect on Screen Monkey. Best way to understand it is to have a 
	 play and do not forget you can always save and load the settings. 
	 When you first install Screen Monkey some defaults are setup, to change 
	 these select &quot;Mouse and Keyboard&quot; in the settings window.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3"><a name="Repair_Clip"></a>Repair

	<br>
	If a clip is unable to load for some reason, such as a missing file,

	 the clip you will be asked if you want to repair the clip and in the 
	 case of a missing file you will be presented with an option to try 
	 and locate the missing file. This is specifically useful if you load 
	 the show in another computer which does not have your clip files located 
	 in the same place.</p></li>
