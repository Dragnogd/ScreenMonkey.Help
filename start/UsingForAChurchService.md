<h1>Using Screen Monkey for a Church Service</h1>
<p class="hcp2">In this example, we will use Screen Monkey 
 to help us with a church service. The church service will contain the 
 following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead in music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead in music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadIn.MP3</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Opening Song</span><br>
	<br>
	The Congregation sings and lyrics are projected on the wall using a 
	 PowerPoint file named <span class="hcp4">Opening.PPT</span>.</p></li>
	<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp3">Prayer 
	 or Meditation</span> </p></li>
	<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp3">Discussion</span> 
	 </p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Offering</span> <br>
	<br>
	During the offering, music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">Offering.MP3</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Announcements</span><br>
	<br>
	The announcements are stored in a video clip named <span class="hcp4">Announcements.FLV</span> 
	 that is projected on the wall.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Closing Song</span> <br>
	<br>
	The Congregation sings and lyrics are projected on the wall using a 
	 PowerPoint file named <span class="hcp4">Closing.PPT</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead out music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead out music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadOut.MP3</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, we need to be able to easily present different types 
 of media. For our example church service, we have three different audio 
 files in MP3 format, a video file in FLV format and two different PowerPoint 
 presentations in .PPT format.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 12px;">Preparing Screen Monkey before the service</h2>
<p>Long before the church service begins, you will want to prepare Screen 
 Monkey. </p>
<p>First, we add these files to Screen Monkey.</p>
<p>To add a media file to Screen Monkey, you click once on any of the blank 
 squares.</p>
<p>(These blank squares are called &quot;slots&quot;)</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ClickEmptySquare.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>After you click a slot, the <span class="hcp3">Create 
 Clip</span> dialog opens.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\CreateClip.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Since the first thing we are likely to do is play the lead in music, 
 we find and click the <span class="hcp3">Audio</span> icon 
 followed by <span class="hcp3">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp3">Open</span> dialog should display 
 allowing us to browse to where the music content is located. </p>
<p>Choose the desired audio file and click <span class="hcp3">Open</span>. 
 In this case, the file name is <span class="hcp3">LeadIn.mp3</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\OpenAudio.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The main Screen Monkey window (called the Dashboard) should now look 
 like this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\FirstClipAdded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The process of adding clips is repeated as shown above until the Screen 
 Monkey dashboard looks similar to this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\AllAdded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>At this point we are now ready to USE Screen Monkey during our church 
 service.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Presenting the media during the church service</h2>
<p>Playing the Clips couldn't get much simpler. You click the clip to play 
 it!</p>
<p>Let's walk through the process of presenting our church service. As 
 our service begins, we need to play our Lead In music. So we click the 
 first clip and the Lead In music should begin playing.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\FirstClipPlaying.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Notice how the clip outline turned yellow and you see a small yellow 
 triangle in the upper right corner to let you know it's playing. Also 
 note the letter <span class="hcp3">A</span> in the upper 
 left corner of the clip. This indicates the clip is playing on the <span class="hcp4">Audio</span> layer. 
 </p>
<p>When it's time to begin the service you would likely need to stop the 
 audio if is still playing. Just click once on the LeadIn.mp3 clip and 
 it will stop playing.</p>
<p>At this point in the service the congregation sings along and song lyrics 
 are presented for them to use. You click the first PowerPoint clip and 
 the song lyrics should present on the projector. Again, the clip outline 
 should turn yellow to indicate it's playing.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\PresentPowerPoint.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>To advance slides in the PowerPoint presentation, click the clip again. 
 Each successive click should advance the PowerPoint presentation to the 
 next slide.</p>
<p>For the rest of the service you would simply click the clips when you 
 need them so they begin playing.</p>
<p>As you can hopefully see, it's really easy to present the content. Once 
 you are finished playing any given clip, click the &quot;Clear Layer&quot; 
 clip on the left side of Screen Monkey. That will totally clear the layer 
 and immediately stop playing the selected clip.</p>
<p>Using Screen Monkey there was no need for opening PowerPoint, then opening 
 the desired presentation, then starting the slide show. There was also 
 no need to locate the audio files, open and play them using a media player. 
 No need to locate the announcements video file, open it and play it using 
 a media player. Possibly having the player open on the main screen of 
 the PC and having to drag it into the second monitor to present it. </p>
<p>Instead, the show was polished and seamless!</p>
