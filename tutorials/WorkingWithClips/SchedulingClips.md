<h1>Scheduling Clips</h1>
<p>Screen Monkey allows you to configure pre-determined times for clips 
 to play. This may be useful for a TV station where a commercial advertisement 
 needs to play at a specific time. Or perhaps you are using Screen Monkey 
 for a concert and an intro should begin playing at a pre-determined time.</p>
<h2>To schedule a clip:</h2>
<p>Right-click the clip and choose Schedule.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp2">Schedule</span> dialog is presented.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../images/Schedule1.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Click <span class="hcp2">Add</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp2">Change Schedule Time</span> dialog 
 is presented.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../images/Schedule2.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Ensure the Enabled option is configured, then configure the Date, Time 
 and Repeat options and click <span class="hcp2">OK</span>.</p>

		 has no meaning. If the Scheduled Time has been reached, Screen 
		 Monkey will not re-schedule or remind you that a schedule was 
		 missed.</td>
