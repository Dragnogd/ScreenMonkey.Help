<h1>Using Screen Monkey for a Concert</h1>
<p class="hcp2">In this example, we will assume we are using 
 Screen Monkey to help us with a concert. The concert will contain the 
 following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead in music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead in music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadIn.MP3</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Image with Concert Logo</span><br>
	<br>
	While the Lead in music is playing an image with the concert logo is 
	 presented via multiple projection systems. The concert logo is an 
	 image named <span class="hcp4">ConcertOpener.PNG</span>.</p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span class="hcp3">Master 
	 of Ceremonies</span><br>
	<br>
	A live video feed will present all stage activity on the projection 
	 systems. The computer is equipped with a video capture device named 
	 <span class="hcp4">Video WebCam</span>.</p></li>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Supplemental Images and Lower 
	 Thirds</span> <br>
	<br>
	During the live performances, <a href="../Glossary.md#LowerThird">Lower 
	 Thirds</a> will be used to identify the Emcee and the performers. 
	 Before each group performs, an image announcing the group name and 
	 logo will be presented. During the live performances, the camera will 
	 be all over the place. Sometimes the whole group will be shown and 
	 sometimes there will be close ups of performers. When there are close 
	 ups, Lower Thirds will be superimposed on the live video to identify 
	 the performer. There are many images involved.</p></li>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Emcee.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Emcee) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group1.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(full image identifying Band 1) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group1Performer1.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 1 Performer 1) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group1Performer2.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 1 Performer 2) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group1Performer3.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 1 Performer 3) &#160;</p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group2.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(full image identifying Group 2) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group2Performer1.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 2 Performer 1) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group2Performer2.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 2 Performer 2) </p></li>
		<li class="hcp5"><p><span class="hcp4">Group2Performer3.PNG</span><br>
		<br>
		(lower third identifying Group 2 Performer 3) </p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p><span class="hcp3">Lead out music</span><br>
	<br>
	The Lead out music is played using an MP3 file named <span class="hcp4">LeadOut.MP3</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, we need to be able to easily present different types 
 of media. For our example concert, we have two different audio files in 
 MP3 format, a live video feed and several different images that will be 
 presented and even superimposed over the video.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 12px;">Preparing Screen Monkey before the concert</h2>
<p>Long before the concert begins, you will want to prepare Screen Monkey. 
 </p>
<p>First, we add these files to Screen Monkey.</p>
<p>To add a media file to Screen Monkey, you click once on any of the blank 
 squares.</p>
<p>(These blank squares are called &quot;slots&quot;)</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ClickEmptySquare.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>After you click the slot, the <span class="hcp3">Create 
 Clip</span> dialog opens.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\CreateClip.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Since the first thing we are likely to do is play the lead in music, 
 we click the <span class="hcp3">Audio</span> icon followed 
 by <span class="hcp3">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp3">Open</span> dialog should display 
 allowing us to browse to where the music content is located. </p>
<p>For this example, I placed all the content inside the same folder. I 
 selected the <span class="hcp4">LeadIn.MP3</span> 
 file and clicked <span class="hcp3">Open</span>.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\OpenAudio.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The main Screen Monkey window (called the Dashboard) should now look 
 like this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\FirstClipAdded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>The process of adding clips is repeated as shown above until the Screen 
 Monkey dashboard looks similar to this:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ConcertLoaded.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>At this point we are now ready to USE Screen Monkey during our concert.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Presenting the media during the Concert</h2>
<p>Let's walk through the process of presenting the show at our concert. 
 As the concert begins, we need to play our Lead In music as well as present 
 the concert image. So we click the LeadIn clip once and the Lead In music 
 should begin playing. Then we click the Concert image once and it should 
 begin presenting on the projection system.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ConcertStart.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Notice how the clip outlines turn yellow. For the audio clip, a small 
 yellow triangle appears in the upper right corner to let you know audio 
 is playing. Also note the letter <span class="hcp3">A</span> 
 in the upper left corner of the clip. This indicates the clip is playing 
 on the <span class="hcp4">Audio</span> 
 layer. Notice the clip to the immediate right. This is the concert image 
 and the bright yellow border indicates it's the active layer. If you look 
 at the left side of the Dashboard, the L1 square is highlighted to let 
 you know Layer 1 is presenting the image.</p>
<p>When the Master of Ceremonies (Emcee) approaches the stage it's time 
 to stop the LeadIn music and start the live video feed. Notice the little 
 row of squares on the left side of the Main Dashboard. Each of these represents 
 a layer. Click the <span class="hcp3">Audio</span> layer 
 to select it, then click the <span class="hcp3">Clear Audio</span> 
 clip.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\ClickAudioLayer.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp3">L1</span> layer to select 
 it, then click the <span class="hcp3">video camera</span> 
 icon to start the feed and the live video will begin presenting on the 
 projection system. We selected L1 because that is the layer that will 
 be &quot;behind&quot; all the others. </p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="..\images\startconcertcamera.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp6"></p>
<p>At this point the Emcee is on stage and about to begin talking to the 
 audience and introduce the first group. When the address begins, you will 
 want to display the <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a1" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Glossary.md#LowerThird',400,150);return false;">lower third</a> that will present the 
 Emcee's name.</p>
<p>To display the lower third, click the <span class="hcp3">L2</span> 
 layer to select it, then click the <span class="hcp3">Emcee 
 clip</span> to present it. Because you first selected L2, the Emcee clip 
 is presented on Layer 2. This means Layer 1 is still presenting the live 
 video feed and Layer 2 is presenting in front of the Live video feed. 
 So your audience sees both at the same time.</p>
<p>From here forward, you would just click the clips as you need them. 
 For example, when the first group comes on stage, you would click their 
 image to announce them. As each performer receives a close up, you click 
 their name to present the lower third.</p>
<p>As you can hopefully see, it's really easy to present the content. Once 
 you are finished playing any given clip, click the layer on the left side 
 to choose it, then click the &quot;Clear Layer&quot; clip on the left 
 side of Screen Monkey. That will totally clear the layer and immediately 
 stop playing the selected clip.</p>
<p>Using Screen Monkey there was no need for locating the audio files, 
 opening and playing them using a media player. No need to use something 
 like a mechanical A/B switch to change from presenting live video to images 
 or images to live video.</p>
<p>Instead, the show was polished and seamless!</p>
