Saving Window Layout

To make it easy to switch between different layouts or restore a previous layout that was saved you can save your window positions to a view. It is then simple to restore those layouts with one button press.

All your different layouts are managed from the view menu. Either open this from the icon on the dashboard or from the View menu that you get when right-clicking.



To save a view, arrange the windows in the positions you want, then click Views / Window Layout and choose Customize.

The Manage Views dialog opens.



The view manager allows you to add or remove saved views. To save the current view click New and enter the name you want to give to the view.

To delete a view just check the views to delete and select Delete.

Once you have finished click OK.

 

Restore Window Layout

You restore a Window layout by selecting the desired view from the view menu (or the icon on the dashboard). All the windows should move to the position at the point when you saved the view.
