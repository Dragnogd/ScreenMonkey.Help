<h1 class=“rvps4”>Selecting Multiple Clips 
 (aka Multi-Edit Mode)</h1>
<p>You may find yourself wanting to change the settings of more than one 
 clip at a time. This is where multi edit mode is handy. It allows you 
 to select a number of clips and change the settings on all the selected 
 clips in one go. When in multi edit mode you can change the effect, link 
 and layer as well as remove the selected clips.</p>
<p>To enter multi edit mode click the pencil icon or press <span style=“font-weight: bold;”>Ctrl+E</span>.</p>
<p class=“hcp2”><img alt=“” src=“../../images/MultiEditIcon.png” border=“0” class=“hcp3”></p>
<p>The icon background changes to yellow to indicate multi edit mode and 
 the clip borders&#160;begin flashing between blue and green. You may now 
 use the mouse to select a number of clips to be edited.</p>
<p>(clicking on a clip in edit mode does not have the normal result of 
 playing that clip)</p>
<p>Any clips you have selected will be highlighted in blue. You may also 
 select a number of clips by dragging the mouse over the clips you want 
 to select.</p>
<p class=“hcp2”><img alt=“” src=“../../images/img_258.jpg” width=“533” height=“110” border=“0” class=“hcp3”></p>
<p>Another method is to use standard Windows functionality to select the 
 first clip, press and hold Shift, then click to select the last clip.</p>

<p><span class=“rvts10”>When you right-click the selection you will notice 
 that you are presented with a different popup menu.</span></p>
<p>Once you have finished in edit mode, click on the pencil icon or press 
 Ctrl+E to exit.</p>

<h2>Moving Clips</h2>
<p>When in multi-edit mode you can move clips by selecting them and dragging 
 them to a new position. Typically you must click the clip to select it, 
 then click again to begin the click and drag process.</p>
<p>If you are in list view then you can drag items about in the list to 
 re-order them. You can even drag items between spaces and the main dashboard.</p>
