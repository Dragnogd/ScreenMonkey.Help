 Test Card Clip</h1>
<h2>What a Test Card Clip does</h2>
<p>The test card clip contains a library of video test cards for use when 
 setting up and calibrating your equipment. The clip allows you to choose 
 from a library of standard cards and display these to the screen. The 
 cards are digitally generated so there is no loss in quality when resizing 
 to different screen sizes.</p>

<h2>How to configure a Test Card Clip</h2>
<p>When you first add the clip to a slot you are presented with a dialog 
 allowing you to choose the type of Test Card to use. Click to choose the 
 type and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>.</p>

<p>As with other clip types, you may specify a <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithClips/Transitions.md">Transition</a> 
 or assign the Test Card to a specific <a href="../../tutorials/WorkingWithShows/DisplayLayers.md">layer</a>.</p>

<h2>How to use a Test Card Clip during a show</h2>
<p>As Test Cards are typically used for calibration purposes, you should 
 never see them in a show. However, you might want to play a test card 
 after a show ends in order to simulate a TV station that is off the air 
 and no longer broadcasting. </p>
<p>To play the clip you simply click it in the Main Dashboard.</p>
