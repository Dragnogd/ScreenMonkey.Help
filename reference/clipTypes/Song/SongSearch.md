# Searching for Songs

After you have created and saved many songs you will find yourself needing to periodically search for specific songs while you are creating Song Clips.

## Searching for song text

Click in the Search field and begin typing the term you are looking for.

Remember, during the process of [Creating Song Clips](CreatingSongClips.md#SaveLoc) you saw a tip that advised to save the songs to a certain folder. This is the folder you should browse to and select. Then click OK.

As you type into the Search field, Screen Monkey dynamically presents songs containing the text.

## Search Label Filter

The song label filter allows you to narrow the search for a specific song to only those songs associated with the label you apply. This provides an easy means to categorize your songs. You may want to apply a label such as "Christmas Songs" so you can search for only songs for Christmas.

The labels may be added to the search by clicking on the labels to the right of the search field and selecting the label you want to add. A label is removed by clicking on the cross next to the label name.
