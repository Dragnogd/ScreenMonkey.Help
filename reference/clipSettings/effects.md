# Effects

Effects are applied to individual clips and allow you to change the display properties of the clip for the duration of their playback. For example, an effect may adjust the colour of a clip. Effect parameters can be adjusted while the clip is live which makes it easy to get the desired look.

## Add Effects
To add an effect, right click on the clip and select ‘Effects’ and the Clip Effects dialog is presented.
