<h1>Choose Different Media</h1>
<p>Sometimes you have a Clip already in place, but you wish to change the 
 image, sound file or video clip the clip contains.</p>
<p>For example, you may have different audio clips that are used as lead 
 ins to church services. Perhaps one is used for a Sunday service but another 
 is used for a Wednesday evening service. You don't wish to create an entirely 
 new show as you would like to just continue using the existing show.</p>
<p>To do this, you use the Swap Media function.</p>
<p>To Swap Media, right-click the clip and choose Swap Media from the menu. 
 Then navigate to and choose the new media you wish to use.</p>
