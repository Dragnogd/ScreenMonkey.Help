# Tips and Tricks


## Clip Forward and Reverse

You may have added a number of clips and all you want to do is step through them. The Clip Forward function allows you to do this. When you select Clip Forward it will move to the next clip on the layer which is simply the clip in the next slot. This is different from the linked clip. To move back to the previous clip, select Clip Reverse.

You can either assign hotkeys to the these actions or click the Go button in the [Layers Dashboard](../WorkingWithShows/LayersDashboard.md). By holding down shift and clicking Go, it will move to the previous clip.
