<h1>Adding Transitions</h1>
<p>Transitions allow you to configure how a specific clip makes its appearance 
 when it is shown on the screen. When a clip is played it simply appears 
 over the top of whatever else the monitor may be displaying. </p>
<p>For example, if no application is showing on the screen, you would typically 
 see the Windows Desktop wallpaper. When you play a clip it will then abruptly 
 appear in front of the Desktop Wallpaper.</p>
<p>By configuring a Transition, the clip might gently fade into view as 
 opposed to abruptly appearing. </p>
<p>There are many Transition effects to choose from and different parameters 
 which specify how the effect behaves.</p>

<h2>Selecting and Setting Up a Transition Effect</h2>
<p>To set the effect of a clip right-click the clip in the Screen Monkey 
 application to display the popup menu. From the menu select &quot;Transition&quot;. 
 This will present the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clip Transition</span> 
 dialog.</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="../../images/ClipTransition.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>
<p>The default effect is &quot;No Effect&quot; which means the clip will 
 simply pop onto the screen. There are a number of effects to choose from, 
 but we will examine Fade. To change the effect to Fade, select Fade from 
 the list of effects on the left side of the dialog.</p>
<p>Simply selecting the Fade effect is not enough. To set the effect, you 
 must also specify an effect speed or nothing will happen. </p>
<p>To change the speed take one of the following actions.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Type a new speed value into the field</p></li>
	<li><p>Click the Up or Down arrow buttons</p></li>
	<li><p>Click the Fast, Med or Slow buttons</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The speed specifies the time in seconds for the effect to complete.</p>
<p>Depending on the Transition effect you select, there may be other configuration 
 options. For example, the Fade Wipe, Fly and Hard Wipe effects also allow 
 you to select a direction used for the Transition effect.</p>

		 will simply appear as if the effect was set to none.</td>

<h2>WPF Effects</h2>
<p>When using the <a class="rvts13" href="..\..\reference\setup\settings\DisplayRenderer.md">WPF renderer</a> 
 you may be able to use the new 3D transition effects. These effects will 
 only be available to you if the WPF renderer is selected in the Screen 
 Monkey <a href="../../Reference/Setup/Settings/Settings.md">settings</a>.</p>
