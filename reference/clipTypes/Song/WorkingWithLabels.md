<h1>Working With Labels</h1>
<p>When you create Song Clips you have an ability to create Labels. Labels 
 are a handy way of finding Songs later. For example, for a church setting 
 you may wish to define a Label of Christmas songs. Then associate it with 
 all the different songs using a Christmas theme. Or perhaps Easter. Or 
 perhaps you are presenting song lyrics at a concert. You could define 
 labels by the group that will be performing.</p>
<p class="rvps8">Labels can assist when you need to <a href="SearchingForSongs.md">Search 
 for songs</a>.</p>
<p class="rvps8">&#160;</p>
<h2>To associate a label with a song:</h2>
<p>Open the <span class="hcp2">Cue / Edit</span> dialog for 
 the song by clicking the middle mouse button or right-clicking and choosing 
 <span class="hcp2">Edit / Cue</span>.</p>
<p>Click the <span class="hcp2">Label</span> drop-down and 
 give the song a Label.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SongLabel1.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Press <span class="hcp2">Enter</span> after typing the 
 Label and the dialog should change a bit.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SongLabel2.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>You may repeat this process to add as many labels as needed.</p>
<p>Click <span class="hcp2">OK</span> after adding the label 
 and Screen Monkey should issue the following prompt:</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="../../../images/SongEditWarning.png" alt="" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>Click <span class="hcp2">Yes</span> to save the updated 
 song.</p>
<p>After you have added Labels, you may then use them when <a href="SearchingForSongs.md">Searching 
 for Songs</a>.</p>

<h2>To remove a label</h2>
<p class="rvps8">A label is removed by clicking on the cross next to the 
 label name.</p>
