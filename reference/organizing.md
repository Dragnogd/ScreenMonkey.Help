# Organising Clips

The dashboard is where all your clips will live. To keep things organised there are many pages which can be used for any purpose which fits your show or event.  For example you could have a page for videos and a page for music or a page for each day of the event or for each type of session.

There are a number of tools which will help you keep everything organised.

- [Rename](clipSettings/rename.md) a clip and change the icon
- [Move](toolbar/edit.md) a clip
- [Clear](clipSettings/clear.md) clips (an empty slot is left behind) 
- [Remove](clipSettings/remove.md) clips (the gap is closed and subsequent clips shuffle up)
- [Cut/Copy/Paste](clipSettings/cutCopyPaste.md) to duplicate or clip or move clips between pages
- [Page bookmarks](pages.md)
- [Add Notes](clipSettings/notes.md) and [View Notes](toolbar/notes.md)
