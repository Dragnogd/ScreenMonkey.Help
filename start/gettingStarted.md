# Quick Reference

## Outputs

In most cases you will need a secondary display connected to the computer running Screen Monkey which will be used to display the media, text or presentations. The secondary display could be a large screen, a projector, a vision mixer or a video encoder. As long as Windows can see it Screen Monkey can use it. Configure Screen Monkey to use the secondary display in [Display Profiles](DisplayProfiles.md).

## Loading a Clip

Drag a media or image or PowerPoint file from Windows Explorer and drop it onto one of the empty panels. Alternatively left click on any empty panel and choose a clip type.
