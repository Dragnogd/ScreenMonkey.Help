<h1>Events and Errors</h1>
<p>No one likes to get an error message, least of all in the middle of 
 an important show. That's why a lot of effort is put into ensuring that 
 Screen Monkey runs without problems. However, if something should go wrong 
 it should be handled automatically. </p>
<p>Instead of showing an error message in the middle of a show, any errors 
 are handled automatically and saved in a log for you to look at later. 
 If an error does occur you will be notified by the appearance of an exclamation 
 mark in the control panel. If a clip will not run or has problems loading, 
 you may click the exclamation icon to learn more about the problem.</p>
<p>You &#160;may also save a copy of the log. This may be useful to send 
 to Screen Monkey support. After analyzing the information, they may be 
 able to help prevent the problem from occurring again.</p>
<p>If the exclamation mark is not visible and you want to look at the events 
 log then it can be also accessed from the <a href="Settings/Settings.md">Screen 
 Monkey Settings</a>.</p>

<p>A list of all events that have occurred are shown and can be filtered 
 to only show events that have occurred since you started the program, 
 the last 24 Hours or all events that have ever occurred.</p>
<p>When you double click on an event in the list, more detailed information 
 about that event is presented.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong and you need to report it to Screen Monkey support, 
 it is helpful if you attach a copy of this event log. You can save a copy 
 of the log by selecting &quot;Save Event Log&quot;.</p>
<p>Once you have viewed any event the exclamation mark in the main window 
 will disappear.</p>
