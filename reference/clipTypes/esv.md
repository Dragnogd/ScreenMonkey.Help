# ESV Passage

The ESV clip allows you to very easily add text from the English Standard Version Bible. The clip allows you to search for a passage and then add it as a new text clip. Multiple passages from different books or chapters in the Bible can be added to the same clip. 

*Note:* The ESV clip uses an online database. An internet connection is required to add new passages. If you save a show containing ESV clips then an internet connection is not required for playback.

## Playback
Playback works in a very similar way to [song clips](Song/SongClip.md). Activate the clip by left clicking on the dashboard icon in the normal way. Then step through the text pages by either left clicking repeatedly on the clip icon or choosing a text section in the [live preview](../toolbar/preview.md) monitor.

## Formatting
In a similar way to Song and Text clips the text formatting, layout and background of the ESV passage can be changed by right clicking on the clip icon in the dashboard and selecting ‘Display Options’. The following items are specific to this clip type. 

- **Verse Number** displays the verse number of the displayed text, for example ‘John 1:4’. 

- **Passage Reference** displays the reference for all passages included in the clip, for example ‘John 1:1-2:10’

Both of these are optional, to hide them choose ‘Hide’ from the ‘Visible’ toolbar item. For all other display settings refer to the [text clip](Text/TextClip.md) pages.
