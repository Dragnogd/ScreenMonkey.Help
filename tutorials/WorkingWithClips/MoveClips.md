<h1>Moving Clips</h1>
<p>You can move a clip to different slots or between spaces and the main 
 dashboard. Exactly how you move a clip depends on which dashboard view 
 you are in.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">From the Main Dashboard</p>
<p>To move items in the Main Dashboard you must be in <a href="SelectingMultipleClips.md">multi 
 edit mode</a>. When in this mode you may drag the clip items around to 
 move them to different slots.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/moveclip.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>You may also click and drag clips from the Main Dashboard to any space 
 clips to move them from the dashboard into the space.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">From List View</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The Main Dashboard offers two different 
 views. Panel and List. The default is Panel but if you prefer, you may 
 open the Screen Monkey Settings and change to List.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/PanelStyle.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p>In list view click the row containing the clip you want to move and 
 drag it to the row you want to move it to.</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" src="../../images/movecliplist.png" border="0" class="hcp4"></p>
<p style="margin-left: 12px;">You may also click and drag clips from the 
 List View (if editing a space) to move them from the Space List to the 
 Main Dashboard.</p>
